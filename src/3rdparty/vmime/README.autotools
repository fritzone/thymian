Where are the ./configure script and the Makefile's?

Configure and Make scripts are not included in the git source tree. They are
automatically generated by the CMake script.

Just use the following instruction to generate everything needed for the
traditional "make" and "make install" build process.

   cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"

Please note that "configure" script is not needed anymore, as platform
checks are now done by CMake.
