### Ingredients
- 2 - 3 eggs
- Wheat flour
- Breadcrumbs
- Boneless meat: chicken breast or pork (neck, tenderloin) or veal. The original recipe from Vienna uses veal
- Salt, pepper.
- Sunflower oil, about 1/2 liter. Do not use any other oil for this recipe.

### Preparation
Take 3 flat plates. In the first one of them, you put in the flour, in the second you put the breadcrumbs.

 In the third, you will have the Schnitzels when done. Take a deeper plate, large enough to fit in a piece of meat and whisk the eggs well in it.

 Place the plates as from left to right, next to each other: first with flour, then the plate with the eggs, then the breadcrumbs. Place them right next to the pan (which is on the stove) with the hot oil, and after the pan, the empty plate where you want to put the schnitzels.

 Wash the meat, cut it into thin slices, add salt and pepper and use a meat tenderizer to flatten it. Now sprinkle salt and pepper on the meat, and place them in the flour, on both sides so that the flour covers it completely.

 You can pat the meat on the flour if it does not cover completely. The next step is to place the meat in the egg.

 Feel free to use tweezers if you do not want to get your hands dirty. Soak it well on both sides of the eggs.

 After the eggs have the meat into the breadcrumbs, cover well on both sides and now it's time to fry it in the oil. When the colour is a nice brown / yellow the meat is done (it takes about 5-6 minutes).

 Take it out on the third flat plate. The oil should not be very hot, otherwise it burns the food, but it should also not be too cold, otherwise it dries out the meat until it becomes brown on the outside.

 Experiment until you find the perfect temperature. Schnitzel goes well with french-fries and pickled cucumber, or potato salad.
