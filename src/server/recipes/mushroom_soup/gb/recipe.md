### Ingredients
- Mushrooms. I have used fresh champignon, but of course you use the mushrooms you like
- Parsley
- 1 medium or 2 small onions
- 2 - 3 garlic cloves
- Salt, pepper, paprika, vinegar
- Oil and flour
- Sour cream
- Rosemary, marjoram, fresh not dry

### Preparation
Wash and / or clean your mushrooms, and cut them into small cubes, slices or other geometric shapes you prefer. Pour boiling water over them, and soak for a few minutes.

 This will remove the brownness of the fungus if you use fresh mushrooms. While the mushrooms are in the water, finely chop the onions and fry them lightly on the oil, together with the finely chopped parsley leaves, rosemary and marjoram.

 When the onion is brown but not burnt, put the crushed garlic on top, then the mushrooms, mix it well, and add a little water (ca 1 dl. should be enough), salt, pepper, paprika, and simmer until the mushrooms are soft enough for your taste.

 Stir often. When the mushrooms are soft enough, pour enough water into the pot to get the amount of soup you are aiming for and let it boil.

 While the soup is boiling, make a roux of wheat flour and oil, and when the roux is done mix it into the soup, bring it to a boil again. Season with salt, pepper and vinegar.

 When serving, add a little finely chopped parsley and finish.
