### Ingredients
- 30 dkg. pork liver, diced
- 60 dkg. Pork meat, diced. Feel free to use the neck without bones or any parts of pigs that have a little fat on.
- 60 dkg. fat bacon, diced
- 3 medium onions
- Some spices, such as: clove, allspice, nutmeg. Make your own mix from spices you like. Use a mortar and pestle.
- Salt, pepper
- Some pork fat/lard or oil

### Preparation
In a pan, add a little pork fat or oil, the bacon pieces, and fry until almost crispy. Add the finely chopped onions and let the onion simmer with the bacon until it is shiny and soft, but do not let it burn.

 Add the diced meat, and a little water and let it cook until the meat is soft. Depending on the cut it may take 30 minutes or more.

 While the meat is cooking, clean the liver of the membranes and veins and cut it into medium-sized pieces. When the meat is soft have in the liver pieces.

 Cover and cook everything together for approx. 5 – 10 minutes, but do not let the liver become hard and dry.

 Remove from the heat and allow to cool. When it is completely cold, take everything out of the pan and use a meat grinder and grind all together for at least 2 times.

 You can also use a food processor. Put it back in the same pot you cooked it in and put it back on the stove.

 Season it with salt, pepper, and the spice mixture you have crafter before, and cook it for at least 20 – 30 minutes on low heat. When done, place it in a jar, seal it tightly, cover it with a kitchen towel and place it under a blanket overnight so that it cools slowly.

 When cool it’s ready to eat, and from now on, store in the fridge. If you want, you can make a good topping cream using it, by adding a little room temperature butter (¼ part butter goes well with ¾ part liver pate) and 1 teaspoon mustard.

 If you want a hardboiled egg cut into small pieces can go inside. It goes perfectly with pickles or tomatoes.
