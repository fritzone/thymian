### Ingredients
- A good piece of fatty bacon, ca ½ kg, it is up to you to find your favourite.
- 4 – 5 big garlic cloves
- Paprika, salt, pepper, a few bay leaves, red paprika powder

### Preparation
Wash the bacon and put it in cold water in a with the finely chopped garlic and bay leaves. Cook up the water (with the bacon inside) and lower the heat to a minimum so that the bacon still continues to boil and simmer for 1 – 1.

5 hours, or even more, until the bacon and the skin on the bacon are soft. Take the bacon out of the pan, cut shallowly over the surface in a grid layout with a sharp knife, put on salt, pepper and the rest of the garlic in thin slices and sprinkle on top red paprika powder.

 Put it in a plate and let it cool. When it is cold, wrap it tightly in a plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight.

 You can eat it next morning, and the leftovers are good for up to a few days, if you keep it in the fridge. Do not eat this bacon while still warm, it is not a light food for the stomach.
