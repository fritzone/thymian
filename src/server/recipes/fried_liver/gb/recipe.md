### Ingredients
- Oil
- Pepper
- Salt
- Pork liver (Or beef liver, lamb liver, chicken or goose liver)

### Preparation
  Cut the liver into 1 - 2 cm thick slices. In a frying pan put in oil, and when the oil is hot enough have in the liver slices.

 Bake for a maximum of 2 minutes on each side (if they are thick, cook a little more) and take them out of the frying pan. Season with salt and pepper now, not before frying.

  Just eat, do not let it cool down otherwise it will become stiff.  If you make this food with a few sides (it goes great with mashed potatoes, French-fries or boiled rice), I recommend preparing all the sides, plates, table settings in advance, and just put these grilled liver pieces on the plate directly from the pan.
