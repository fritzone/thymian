### Ingredients
- 10 - 15 boiled potatoes cut in slices
- 5 - 6 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
- White cheese (like feta), yellow cheese, grated cheese
- Sour cream
- Salt, pepper
- Butter, breadcrumbs
- Olives
- Sausages with paprika
- Bacon

### Preparation
Take a loaf pan and butter the bottom and sides with butter. Drizzle bread crumbs on the butter.

 If you use bacon, have a layer of bacon on the bottom. Afterwards lay in the pan a layer of potato slices.

 On the potatoes put a little grated yellow cheese or white cheese bits and sour cream, and afterwards a layer of eggs. On the eggs add a little salt, pepper and grated cheese, and a new layer of potatoes on top.

 Add more sour cream, cover with yellow cheese slices and place in the oven at 180 degrees, approx. 30 - 45 minutes.

 If you want to use some of the other "It's nice to have in" Ingredients just throw them in between the layers, there is really no rule for this. What is important is that in the end you get a good and tasty food.
