For this dish, you either use some leftover potatoes from yesterday, or just make a new portion and use them. Also feel relaxed about the ingredients. If you do not have white cheese, use yellow one, if you do not have sour cream, donâ€™t use sour cream. The eggs are kind of necessary. Meat is also optional, use it if you have / like, otherwise it is okay to just skip them.
