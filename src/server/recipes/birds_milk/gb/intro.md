Not that birds can provide you with milk, but this dessert of French origin is highly popular in Transylvania. Howeve, when it was introduced from France, it demanded ingredients so expensive that it was as rare as the famous bird milk. Today, vanilla is not an exquisite neither an awfully expensive ingredient, so you can make it at home as well. It is no less tasty than what you buy from a high-end patisserie.
