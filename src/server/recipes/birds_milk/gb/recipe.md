### Ingredients
- 4 egg whites + 4 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 800 ml of milk
- 1 vanilla bean
- 40 gr. sugar
- 30 gr. vanilla sugar

### Preparation
Whisk the egg whites until they start to become frothy and slightly white, and add 2 tablespoons of sugar. Whisk until you get a very hard foam (about 10-15 minutes or more), and let it rest.

 Scrape the vanilla seeds from the vanilla bean, put them in the milk, together with the bean and boil it in a non-stick pot (Teflon) you use to boil milk. When the milk boils, cut out small dumplings with a spoon from the egg white foam, and boil them in the milk for 2 â€“ 3 minutes on each side, then take them out in a large bowl.

 Wash the spoon in between if you notice that it becomes sticky. Remove the milk from the heat, allow to cool slightly.

 Stir together the egg yolk with the sugar until it is well frothy, pour in some of the lukewarm milk and stir immediately until it is smooth. Add the remaining milk, add the vanilla sugar, stir together, and pour it all back into the milk bowl.

 Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until nicely thick, then allow to cool. Put the boiled egg white foam bowls on top and put it all in the fridge at least 2-3 hours before you want to serve.
