- 5 - 6 crushed garlic cloves

- Cumin

### Preparation
Start by mixing the meat, rice and onion with salt and pepper. If you use garlic and paprika powder, they should go into the mixture.

 When you have a good mixture, let it rest for 30 minutes, while you wash, clean and cut the right size the sauerkraut leaves. A small advice for the good size is that you should be able to wrap a small handful of meat from the meat mixture, and then roll it up without it opening again.

 About twice the size of the palms will be a good size. Lay on the side a few leaves you will use them later (to cover the pot).

 When you are done with all the leaves, take a casserole and place a layer of bacon slices on the bottom, a thin layer of meat on the bacon and a layer of finely chopped sauerkraut. Place a layer of sausage slices on the shredded sauerkraut.

 If you use bay leaves, put them on the sausages. Now make those rolls.

 Place a nice amount of meat on the side of a leaf, and roll up, starting from the side with the meat on, in a short sausage-like shape. Fold in the edges so that it does not open during cooking.

 When you have finished a roll, place it on top of the sausages, and repeat until you are empty of meat or leaves (put the new one next to the previous roll in the pot). If you run out of leaves, make small meatballs from the rest of the meat, and place them on the side, we can use them later in another recipe or in this one as filling.

   Now you should have a nice layer with the stuffed cabbage rolls, if there are any gaps between them, fill it with a piece of smoked meat or a meatball you may have made in between. Now place the remaining shredded cabbage on top of the rolls.

 If you use cumin, sprinkle the sauerkraut with it. Afterwards, place the remaining meat and meatballs on top of the shredded cabbage.

 If you use red paprika powder, sprinkle a good portion on, and cover all with the leaves you have set aside at the beginning. Fill it with enough water to cover all the cabbage, put on the lid and cook for 2 - 3 hours on low heat (it should not burn), or until the cabbage and meat are done.

 Do not forget to add a good splash of sour cream when serving.
