This is possibly the most complex recipe presented in our book, but this is a must try food for anyone who wants to experience real Transylvanian food in its full richness. Like every popular dish, this one also has a very varied method of preparation, each family has its own sworn recipe. This food is so popular that there is even a festival dedicated to it in the small village of Praid / Parajd which is held at the end of September every year, when the annual sauerkraut is at its best. This is our recipe, and yes, our grandparents come from the aforementioned small village.
