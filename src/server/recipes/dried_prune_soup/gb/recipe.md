### Ingredients
- ½ kg of pork, preferably with bones
- A good bit of smoked bacon
- 2 – 3 carrots
- 2 tablespoons of rice
- 2 eggs
- Oil, flour, red paprika cream
- Sour cream, sugar
- Salt, pepper, lemon juice
- A dozen dried prunes
- Lard if you have

### Preparation
Start by dicing the meat and bacon and cook them in a casserole until the meat is almost done. Boil no more than 20-25 minutes.

 While the meat is cooking, clean and cut the carrot into cubes and fry them in hot oil or lard. When the carrot is done, put them (and the oil you have fried them in) into the casserole with the meat, add 2 tablespoons of rice, add a little salt, and pepper and cook until the meat is soft.

 While the soup is cooking, make a hard dough from the 2 eggs, a little water and flour. Stretch it up to half a finger thickness (approx.

 0.5 cm) and cut it into cubes.

 In a frying pan, fry all the pieces in a small quantity of oil (fry them in small portions, so as not to have to use a lot of oil so that the soup does not become very greasy). When the meat is soft, put it in a spoonful of paprika cream into the pot, bring to the boil.

 Make a roux of oil and flour and mix it well into the soup. Taste the soup once more with salt, pepper, lemon juice, put in the prunes and bring to the boil once more.

 When serving add in some sour cream and sugar, a handful of the fried dough cubes, and done.
