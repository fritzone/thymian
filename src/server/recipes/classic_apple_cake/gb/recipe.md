### Ingredients
- ½ kg flour
- 250 gr. butter at roomtemperature
- 2 eggs
- ½ dl. milk
- 1 packet of fresh yeast
- a little sugar
- 1 – 2 kg. apples
- Cinnamon

### Preparation
Take the apples and clean them, and if they are old peel them, cut out brown bumps and coarsely grate the apples with a grater (on the largest hole). When all the apples are done grating, mix them with a little cinnamon if you like, a teaspoon of sugar, and let them rest in peace until you work on the other parts of the cake.

 Put the yeast in warm milk together with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Stir in the yeast until it is completely dissolved.

 Leave the mixture until the yeast begins to foam vigorously (5 – 10 minutes). Meanwhile, mix the butter with the flour.

 Mix milk with yeast with the flour and eggs, and make a dough. Divide the dough into 2, and using a dough stick, stretch the first part of the dough into a sheet, approx. 2 mm. thickness.

 Grease with a little butter the bottom of a baking pan, sprinkle approx. 1 tablespoon of flour and cover the bottom of the pan with a very thin layer of flour by moving the pan around.

 Place the first sheet in the pan. If the sheet is larger than your frying pan do not panic, just cut off the sides with a knife.

 Now, wash your hands, and take the grated apples and squeeze all the juice from them with your hands, a handful of grated apples at a time. Place the squeezed apple mass on the first dough lying in the pan, take the next handful of apples and repeat.

   Your goal is to cover the first sheet of dough with a thick layer of apples, approx. 1 – 1½ cm thick.

 When you have covered the whole sheet, use your dough stick again and stretch the other part of the dough in another sheet, approx. 2 mm thick.

 Sprinkle the apples with a little sugar. Place the second sheet of the cake on the apples, and using a fork make several holes on the top sheet (so that the steam from the apples can come out).

 Put in the oven and bake at 180 C for about 30 – 45 minutes. When done put on some icing sugar and do not eat it hot
