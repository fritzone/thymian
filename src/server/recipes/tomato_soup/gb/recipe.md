### Ingredients
- Carrots, 1 – 2 or more (Use a purple carrot to have a very unique colour to the soup that you see in the picture)
- 1 Small onion, finely chopped
- Green parsley leaf
- Tomatoes, about 4 – 5 large or more if they are small.
- Tomato juice 0.5 – 1 litre
- Rice or any type of pasta (penne, fettucine, fusilli, etc…), even homemade
- Oil, flour, salt

### Preparation
Start by making a roux with oil and flour in a small pan. Let it cool.

 In a large saucepan, boil approx. 2 litres of water with a little salt and rice (if you use rice).

 Add the carrot and onion, cook until the vegetables are done. Add finely chopped tomatoes, cook again approx.

 10 minutes. If you use pasta, now is the perfect time to have it inside the soup and wait until the pasta is done.

 Put the tomato juice in the saucepan, stir it together and bring to the boil again. Now, in the pan with the roux start mixing the soup with the roux, by adding one soup spoon each time.

 When the mixture is thin enough, put the contents of the pan back in the soup, boil it up and add the parsley leaves. Add the required amount of salt and it is done.

 If it is not sour enough, use lemon juice, not vinegar.
