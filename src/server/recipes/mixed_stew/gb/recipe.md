### Ingredients
- Pork and/or chicken meat
- Chicken, pig, lamb, or beef liver
- A few harder mushrooms, nice, big and fresh, chanterelle, button mushrooms, or similar
- 2 - 3 large onions
- Oil (lard), salt, pepper

### Preparation
Cut the mushrooms into fine thin slices and fry them in small batches, in a small quantity of oil. Set them aside.

  Finely chop the onion and saut√© it in oil or lard, until light brown. Add a little pepper to the onion, cut the meat into cubes and add to the onion.

  Mix together and add a little water. Bake on low heat under a lid, approx. 15 minutes, or until the meat is half done, then add the mushrooms along with the meat.   Cook without a lid, until the meat is tender, replace the water if it evaporates faster than anticipated.

 Meanwhile, cut the liver into pieces, and when the meat is almost done, place it on the top. Keep it boiling on low heat as long as the liver is tender, but do not cook it too well, otherwise the liver will be dry and tasteless.

 Serve it with polenta, pasta, dumplings or similar.
