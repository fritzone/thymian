### Ingredients
- 1 - 2 - 3 squashes or zucchinis
- Dill and oregano
- Vinegar
- Flour and oil
- Salt, red paprika powder

### Preparation
Peel and grate the squash, and cook it in a pot in a little salted water. If you use squash that has a more firm texture, let them cook for 15-20 minutes, but for a zucchini you only need 10.

 While the squash is cooking, make a small amount of roux from oil and flour (about 1 tablespoon should be enough) and when the squash is soft enough, mix the roux into the pot. Add red pepper, a little dill, a little oregano, and cook for 5 minutes (I recommend using a spice bag to have in the dill and oregano, so you can take them out later).

 Season with some vinegar and itâ€™s done.
