### Ingredients
- ca. 20 ripe plums
- 1 kg. small potatoes
- About 30 â€“ 45 dkg. wheat flour
- Sugar, cinnamon, salt
- Butter, breadcrumbs

### Preparation
Wash the plums. If they are large, cut them in half, remove the pit.

 On each of the half plums, put a teaspoon of sugar (with a little cinnamon If you like cinnamon), and then put all the plums to rest. If they are small, just remove the seeds, but otherwise leave the plums intact and fill them with sugar (and cinnamon If you like).

 If you do not own a potato press, clean and peel the potatoes, cut them into cubes, and put them in a pot, otherwise keep the potatoes with skin on in the pot. Boil the potatoes in water with a little salt until soft.

 Put a large pot on the oven and let water boil in. In a frying pan put in the butter, melt it and put in the breadcrumbs.

 Mix often so that they do not burn. Take the potatoes out of the water, if they are diced mash them with a fork, otherwise peel them and use the potato press to mash them.

 The potatoes need to get hot when you do, and you need to work very fast from now on. Mix the potatoes with the flour to get a dough that is not soft, neither hard.

 Use a dough stick and stretch the dough, approx. 0.

5 cm. thickness.

 Cut the dough into squares so large that you can put a plum in the middle, put a plum in the middle, and fold the sides up and make a ball, being careful not to have holes in the dumpling, otherwise the sugar will leak out. When the dumpling is done, put it in the boiling water.

 Throw in one at a time so that the water does not stop boiling. Move it slightly in the water so that it does not stick to the bottom.

 The following steps need to be done in parallel, so unless you can grow extra hands, you need to move fast in order to not to burn the breadcrumbs, to keep the water boiling and not let the dough cool. When making the next dumplings, also check the boiling water in the pot with the dumplings in it.

 When you see that a dumpling has risen to the surface, remove it with a skimmer (a large spoon with lots of small holes in it) and put it in the pan with the breadcrumbs, move it around in there so that the breadcrumbs cover it completely and remove it from there , place it in a bowl where you plan to serve them. Do not leave it in the pan for too long.

 Do not use the skimmer to move the dumpling in the pan around, breadcrumbs stick to it, and you will not have breadcrumbs in the boiling water. And repeat as long as you have plums or dough left.

 When all the dumplings are done, sprinkle them with a little sugar (not powdered sugar) and serve them on the spot. This food is so popular in Transylvania that you can buy a steady side of the road from specialized sellers.

 Worth trying out and comparing the flavours of each one.
