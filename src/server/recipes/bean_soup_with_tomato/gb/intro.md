The classic haricot bean soup is such a basic recipe in Transylvanian cuisine that each family of course has its own recipe. Ours is made with tomatoes and tomato juice, and we swear this is the best soup you can ever make. In case you decide to make this soup without any tomatoes in any form, you will still get a bean soup, except that it is not ours. It is from our neighbour, who swears his soup is the best. I am sure that when you finish this soup, you will swear that yours is the best.
