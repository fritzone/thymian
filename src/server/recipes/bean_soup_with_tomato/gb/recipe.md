### Ingredients
- Beans, approx. 100-300 gr. I have used a mixture of large white, borlotti beans and black beans. You can find your own combination you like and of course you can use canned beans or dry beans as per your preference.
- Pork, ca 250 gr. and a tiny amount of smoked pork bone, or ribs.
- Bacon.
- 1-2 small onions
- Garlic, 2-3 cloves
- 1-2 carrots
- 2-3 tomatoes
- 1 red sweet pepper
- Â½ litres of tomato juice or a small can of tomato puree.
- Wheat flour, oil.
- Vinegar, salt.
- Red paprika powder
- Green parsley

### Preparation
If you use dry beans, soak them in water for at least 12 hours before making the soup, otherwise they will not cook properly. In the same water add a little bacon and smoked pork if it is smoked to have a better taste.

 If the meat you use was prepared with artificial smoke flavouring do not have it along with the beans in the water, it will ruin the taste. If you use dry beans, put them in a large pot, in at least 3 litres of water and let it cook for approx.

 1 hour. If you use naturally smoked pork bones and/or bacon, have it in the water together with the beans.

 After 1 hour, put the rest of the meat in and let it cook for another 1 hour. If you use beans from a tin, just put the meat in the water and cook for 1 hour, or until the meat is tender, and put the beans in afterwards.

 While the meat is cooking clean and peel the carrots, add to the soup. Afterwards clean and chop finely the onions and garlic, the red peppers, and add them to the soup too.

 When the meat and vegetables are tender approx. have the tomatoes peeled, cut in thin slices, put them in the soup and cook for 10 minutes.

 Put in the tomato juice or tomato puree that was dissolved in 1/2 liter of water. Make a roux and when the roux is done mix in a little red paprika powder, add to the soup and cook everything well, for at least now.

 In Transylvania, it is common to eat this soup with salted slices of red onion.
