### Ingredients
- 250 gr. wheat flour + a little for kneading
- Icing sugar
- a little salt
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons sunflower oil
- ca. 20 – 25 gr. fresh yeast + 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 dl milk + 0.5 dl van

### Preparation
Put the yeast in warm milk (approx. 37 C) together with a teaspoon of sugar, stir well, let it rest until it starts to rise.

 Mix the flour, eggs, 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and a little salt, add the yeast (with milk) and make a dough. Knead for at least half an hour, or until your hands are clean of the dough (do not hurry, otherwise the donuts will not be good).

 Cover with a clean cloth and leave it in a warm place for 1 – 1½ hours. It should almost double in size.

 Using a dough stick, stretch the dough into a sheet, approx. 7 mm – 1 cm thick.

 Use a round gingerbread cutter (for the large ones use one with 6 – 7 cm diameter and for the smaller one with 3 – 4 cm or just a solid glass) and cut out the donuts. Knead the leftovers between the circles, stretch again and make more donuts.

 Cover the donuts with a clean cloth and leave them in a warm place for 30 minutes. Fry them in hot oil, first the top side down, and then turn them until both sides are brown.

 Enjoy it with a little icing sugar, or with jam.
