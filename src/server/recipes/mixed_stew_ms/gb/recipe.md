### Ingredients

- Ca. ½ kg. beef tenderloin
- Ca. ½ kg. pork tenderloin
- Ca. 10 dkg. smoked bacon, diced
- 1 dl sour cream and some milk
- 1 large onion finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 glass - about 2 dl. - white wine
- Ca. 10 dkg. mushrooms cut into large pieces
- Salt, pepper, marjoram, cumin
- Peppers or paprika cream
- Oil or lard

### Preparation

Cut the meat into a handful of large slices. In a saucepan put in the
bacon cubes, and if they are not fat, a little oil or lard and fry them
well until they are golden brown. Put in the finely chopped onion and
cook for 5 minutes on a low heat. Put in a teaspoonful of paprika
cream or paprika powder, half a glass of water and cook them together
for a few minutes.

After a few minutes, add the beef tenderloin, salt, pepper, marjoram,
cumin, and 1 dl white wine. Cover the pot with a lid, and cook for
about 30 minutes on low heat.
Now put in the pork, and the other part of the white wine. Put on the
lid, and cook on the smallest fire possible until the meat is soft and
tender.

In a second frying pan, fry the mushrooms for a few minutes, and
afterwards put them in the pot, cook together for a few minutes.
Make a thickening with flour, sour cream and a little milk and put it in
the pot. It's fine to heat it up, but do not boil it afterwards.
