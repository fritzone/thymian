### Ingredients
- A few large red onions
- 1/2 glass of wine per onion, white if you have
- about 200 gr. minced pork per onion
- a little rice
- 2 – 3 garlic boats
- salt, pepper, parsley leaves
- 1-2 litres of clear beef soup or broth
- Sour cream (or whipped cream), flour
- 1 egg yolk

### Preparation
one person. Clean the onions and cut down approx.

 1/5 of the lower part (from the root part). Mix the wine with the beef soup/broth and cook the whole onions until you can separate the onion layers without breaking them.

 Take out the onions and keep the boiling liquid, you will use it later. Remove the 3 – 4 outer layers from each onion and set them aside, keeping them whole since you will fill them later.

 The inner parts chop finely and mix with the crushed garlic and the minced meat. Add salt, pepper, and finely chopped parsley to your taste.

 Add the rice and mix well. Fill each of the outer onion layers with this meat mixture and place the stuffed onions on the bottom of a large casserole dish.

 Pour the liquid you cooked the onions in, over the stuffed onions, just to cover them a little bit, and let them simmer on a low heat until all the meat is soft. Make a thickening of sour cream / whipped cream, the egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of flour, and mix it into the soup.

 Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes before serving. When serving, put the onions in the plate, add a little of the soup around them and as a decoration use a little finely chopped parsley or spring onion.
