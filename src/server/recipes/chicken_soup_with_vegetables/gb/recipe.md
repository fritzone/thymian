### Ingredients
- Chicken meat, feel free to use the pieces you do not want in another dish (for example wing tips, neck, sternum, lower part of chicken legs)
- Vegetable mixture, with carrot, parsnip, parsley root, potato, peas, green beans, turnip, kohlrabi
- 1 – 2 small onions
- 2 – 3 cloves of garlic
- Salt, pepper, lemon juice
- 1 egg yolk and sour cream (or whipped cream)
- It is perfectly fine to use

### a little vegeta or a chicken broth, but be careful with the extra salt these two should bring into the soup.

### Preparation
Put all meat and bones in a large saucepan and cook approx. 30 - 45 min in water with a tiny amount of salt.

 While the meat is cooking, dice the vegetables into or cut them into some other form, and put them in the pot, cook until the vegetables are done. If you use a broth or vegeta have it in the soup along with the vegetables.

 When the vegetables are done, take the pot off the heat and let it cool for approx. 10-15 minutes.

 Make a thickening of sour cream (or whipped cream) and the egg yolk: whip the sour cream (or creme fraiche) with the egg yolks, have a spoonful of the soup into the thickening, mix and have the thickening in the soup. This soup should not be boiled or heated anymore after this point.

 Store the pot in a cold place, when you want to eat always take out the amount you want to eat in a second pot and heat it, do not boil.
