### Ingredients
- Ca. ½ kg of minced pork or beef
- 10 - 15 large kohlrabi leaves (or lettuce, cabbage, grape leaves)
- Ca. 100 gr. rice
- Milk, wheat flour
- Dill
- Salt, pepper, vinegar
- Sour cream

### Preparation
Clean the leaves, boil some water and keep the leaves in for a few minutes to make them soft, but do not boil them. While the leaves are soaking, mix the minced meat with rice, salt and pepper.

 When the mixture is done, take the leaves out of the hot water, wash them in cold and place the minced meat on each, in the form of a small sausage. If there are any leaves left, cut them thinly and put them in the pot you want to cook in.

 If there is meat at the end, make some meatballs or fill a kohlrabi (recipe 24) and place it next to the stuffed leaves. Roll up the leaves, tuck in the edges so that they don’t fall apart and place them in the pot (if the filled leaves are opening up vehemently, use a cooking twine to hold them in place, remove before serving).

 Cover with water and cook until all the meat is done and all the leaves are done cooking. Put the dill in the pot and bring it to the boil again.

 Make a thickening of flour, mix it with a little vinegar and add it to the soup. Bring to the boil, and when serving, add a little sour cream.
