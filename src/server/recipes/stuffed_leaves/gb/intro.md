You can fill all kinds of leaves, like lettuce, cabbage, grapes, but the original recipe for this food requires kohlrabi leaves, so I will stick to them. You might find it difficult to actually get them in a shop (as per my current knowledge), but a visit to your local farmersâ€™ market might be worth a try, there you can discuss directly with the farmers to provide you the leaves required.
