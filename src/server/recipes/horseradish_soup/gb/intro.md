Surprising, but you can make a very tasty soup with horseradish and a few extra Ingredients. Horseradish is also particularly good for colds and flu, it is loaded with vitamins, so we recommend that you use it often, not only in this soup, but also by making a salad from it, by grating it and mixing with vinegar, salt and a grated apple.
