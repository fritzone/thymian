- 1 carrot
- 1 parsnip
- 1 small celery
- 2-3 fresh mushrooms, champignon or oyster mushrooms
- Salt
- Pepper
- Parsley leaves.

### For the homemade pasta
- 1 egg
- Flour
- Salt
- Water

### Preparation
Start by making the pasta: make a very hard dough from the egg, salt, some water and flour. Stretch it out with a dough stretcher very thin (less than ½ millimetres).

 If it becomes difficult to handle, just cut in half and work separately on the two dough sheets. When you think it is thin enough, take a knife and cut it into long very thin strips (like capellini).

 Spread the strips on a flat surface and let them dry. While the pasta dries wash and clean the chicken, leave the skin on, and divide into pieces of good size, making the cut at the joints.

 The fattier the chicken is, the tastier the soup will be. Drop the chicken pieces in boiling water and cook for 1 – 2 minutes.

 Remove the chicken from the boiling water, wash in cold water and dry it. In a pot have in cold water (ca.

 2 litres), put in the chicken pieces, and bring to a boil. Remove the foam when it rises, we want a clear soup.

 When there is no more foam, put on the lid and let it simmer until the meat is half done. Depending on the age of the chicken this can take up to 30 minutes.

 Meanwhile, clean the vegetables and mushrooms and cut them into long thin pieces. If you want the soup to be cleaner, do not add the brown part of the mushrooms.

 When the meat is half done, add the vegetables together with the meat, add salt and pepper to taste and let it cook until everything is fine and soft, and you like the taste. Now, boil the homemade paste in a pot of salty water, remove with a strainer and either put it in the soup or when serving, put the pasta in a plate, pour on the soup, and on top add a little bit of finely chopped parsley.
