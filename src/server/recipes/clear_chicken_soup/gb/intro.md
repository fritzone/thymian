This soup is very similar to a clear broth, but due to the fact that the chicken goes into dissolution after prolonged cooking, you do not need to cook this for half a day. To get the maximum flavour out of vegetables, I recommend cutting them into long thin slices. Homemade pasta is the jewel on the crown.
