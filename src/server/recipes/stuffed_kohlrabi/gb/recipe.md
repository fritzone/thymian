### Ingredients
- 4-5 small and fresh kohlrabi. Do not buy those that are a little soft.
- Minced pork, approx. 150-200 gr.
- Rice
- Salt, pepper
- Oil and flour to make a thickening
- Parsley leaves, sour cream
- Sour cream for serving

### Preparation
Cook the rice until it is almost half done, approx. 5-8 minutes.

 Mix the minced meat with salt, pepper and the half-cooked rice. Hollow out the kohlrabi with a sharp little spoon (grapefruit spoon works very well for me) and fill them with the minced meat.

 The minced meat that did not fit in the kohlrabi should be used to make meatballs. Put the stuffed kohlrabi, the carved out pieces, some parsley leaves and the meatballs in a large pot and cook them for approx.

 45 - 50 minutes in salted water or until the kohlrabi is soft and the meatballs are cooked through. Make a little roux with oil and flour and put it in the soup, cook 10 minutes to mix the flavours.

 The soup is ready now, when serving have a little sour cream or sour cream and green parsley leaves on.
