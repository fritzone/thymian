### Ingredients
- Diced pork, with a little fat on, or with a little bone
- 1 small cabbage
- 1-2 carrots
- 1 small onion
- Milk and wheat flour to make a thickening
- Dill and summer savoury (or a little oregano)
- Salt, pepper, vinegar
- Red paprika powder or paprika sauce

### Preparation

Put the pork to cook in approximately 2 litres of boiling water in a casserole with a little salt and cook for approx. 30 â€“ 45 minutes.

 If you do not like the fatty parts, cut them off the meat but boil regardless together with the rest, and you can remove them later after you have cooked the flavour out of them. While the meat is cooking, cut the cabbage and carrot into bite-sized pieces, finely chop the onion, and put them in the casserole together with the pork.

 When the vegetables are cooked, make a portion of thickening with milk and flour, add a little vinegar into the thickening, and mix the thickening into the ice cream soup. Bring to the boil, add a little red pepper (powder or sauce), pepper If you like, summer savoury (or oregano), dill and cook it again for approx. 10 minutes.

 When serving you can decorate with a little dill.
