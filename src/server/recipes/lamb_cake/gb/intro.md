This traditional Easter recipe for the Romanians in Transylvania is not only very tasty, but also incredibly difficult to prepare in the traditional way, due to the difficulty of finding the right ingredients. Basically, all the offals from lambs such as liver, kidney, lungs, spleen and heart is used, and all of these are wrapped in the peritoneum of the lamb and fried. What I have done here is to use a decent amount of lamb dough along with lamb liver that is available in stores. In Transylvania, every family has their own recipe they swear by.
