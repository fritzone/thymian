### Ingredients
- Minced lamb dough, approx. 1 kg
- Lamb liver, about 0.5 kg
- 2 eggs
- 1 large slice of bread softened in milk
- 1 small slice of bread
- Sour cream
- 1 large cup mixture of herbs: parsley leaves, dill, lovage, marjoram
- 5-6 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 onion
- salt, pepper

### The original recipe needs
- only 0.5 kg of minced meat
- liver, kidney, lung, heart, and spleen of a lamb, about 0.5 kg
- peritoneum of lamb

### Preparation
Use a meat grinder and grind up everything that comes from the lambs, e.g. meat and liver (and the other ingredients if you have found them in one store), along with the onion and all the herbs. Lastly, use a small slice of bread to clean the meat grinder and squeeze the meat out of it.

 Mix together what you have grounded with the crushed garlic, the 2 eggs and the larger slice of bread from the milk, 1 tablespoon of sour cream and season with salt and pepper. Mix for at least 30 minutes to bring the flavours together and let it rest for 10 minutes.

 If using the lamb's peritoneum, wash it several times in a cold van. Place it in a high baking tray, making sure to cover all sides.

 Now place the mixture evenly in the baking tray, and fold over with the peritoneum. If you do not use the peritoneum, have some oil in the baking tray and just put the mixture in.

 Bake in the oven for approx. 30 minutes at 200C and then 15 minutes at 250C, turn off the oven and leave it in the oven until you are ready to serve it.

 This food goes very well with potatoes, and because Easter was always around spring, there were not too many fresh vegetables, so you had to use lots of pickles or pickled peppers next to this food.
