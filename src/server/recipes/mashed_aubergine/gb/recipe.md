### Ingredients
- Aubergine, ca 300 gr.
- Sunflower oil (use only this), ca. ½ - 1 dl for each aubergine, but not more than ½ l altogether.
- Salt
- Onion
- Mayonnaise

### If you like
- A few crushed garlic cloves
- Juice of ½ lemon

### Preparation
If you use raw eggplants, the first step is to grill them on a flame grill, until all the purple skin is burnt to black, and it is crispy, and you can peel it in thin layers with your hands. Since they will be hot, I recommend that you make a bowl of cold water, to dip your fingers in between pieces of peeled skin to cool them.

 Once all the aubergines have been cleaned from the burnt skin, let them rest for a few minutes so that all the bitter juice flows out of them (you can leave them on a flat surface – such as a butcher block – at a slight angle and appeal to gravity to help with processes) After that, using a wooden spoon, mash the inside of the aubergines in a bowl, starting from the end, and slowly scrape off towards the stem. Do not use a mixer for this, it will spoil the food, and do not use a spoon made of metal (iron, aluminium) as it will react with the eggplant, giving it a black colour and a bitter taste (a large plastic spoon is also a good choice if you do not have a wooden spoon).

 When all the aubergines are scraped, mix them well in the bowl, and do not forget to still use your wooden spoon. If you bought half-prepared aubergines from the store in a canned jar, you are already at this stage, so continue from the bottom.

 Add a good amount of salt to your taste, this will be the basis of your cream. Start adding oil to the eggplant cream, small amounts at a time and mix it thoroughly each time so that all the oil entirely dissolves in the eggplant.

 Taste often while mixing, and when you feel you have a tasty enough cream, you can either eat it as it is on a slice of bread, or you can add more flavours to it as desired. The taste should be creamy, not bitter, and not very oily.
