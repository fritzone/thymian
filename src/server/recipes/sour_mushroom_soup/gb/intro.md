This unusual soup gets its distinctive taste from the mushroom mixture you use, so do not skimp on them. There is no specific recommendation for the mushrooms, just use what you like and the better the soup will be. I have used chanterelle, champignon, and oyster mushrooms, but also some boletus and other edible mushrooms will go great in this soup. Be careful, some mushrooms will leave a strong colour pigment on your food (orange milkcap for example).
