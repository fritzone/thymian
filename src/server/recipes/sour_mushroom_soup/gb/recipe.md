### Ingredients
- 1 carrot, 1 parsley root and a little celery (celery stick is good)
- 2 â€“ 3 potatoes
- 1 Small onion
- Mushroom mixture. If you use dried mushrooms, leave them in water overnight or a few hours before starting. If you use frozen mushroom mixture, use frozen, do not let them thaw.
- Salt, pepper, vinegar and paprika
- Wheat flour, oil.
- Spring onion
- Sour/whipped cream makes it more smooth

### Preparation
Slice the carrot, parsley root, celery, and onion, and boil them in salted water, thus making a good vegetable broth. When the vegetables are cooked, either remove and use them in some other recipe, or leave them in the soup.

 I chose the second option. Add the mushrooms to the soup, season with pepper and cook until all the mushrooms are soft and tender.

 Some mushrooms take longer to cook properly than other mushrooms (chanterelles can be very stubborn, put them in firs and give them extra cooking time). Take the mushrooms out of the pot and cut them into small pieces (take out the vegetables too if you keep them).

 Make a small amount of roux with oil and flour, add a little paprika and dissolve with cold water and add it in the soup. Bring to the boil, and while the soup is cooking, cut the potatoes into cubes and have them in the soup along with the mushrooms (and the vegetables), cook until the potatoes are done cooking.

 The soup is done now. Season with salt, pepper and vinegar.

 It is good to have a little sour cream or whipped cream and green spring onion on, as a decoration.
