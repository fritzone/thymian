If you want a warm breakfast, prepared in record time, which is good even in the afternoon (if anything remains), this is a must-try recipe. After the bread is dipped and baked, the topping is up to you. Some people like to eat it with jam (cherries are our favourite, but raspberries go well too) others like to eat it with grated cheese and strong chili (sauce or cayenne pepper) while some others just want a sprinkle of sugar on top.
