### Ingredients
- Bread in slices
- A few eggs
- Milk
- Salt, pepper
- Oil for frying

### And for the topping
- Jam
- Grated cheese
- Cayenne-pepper

### Preparation
In a deep plate, beat the eggs well and add a little milk. Put lots of oil in a frying pan and heat it up.

 Check with a drop of egg from the end of the fork whether it is hot enough or not. If it turns black in a second, it is too hot.

 If it does not start frying immediately, it is not hot enough. Usually, I turn the heat up to the maximum, to heat the oil quickly, but then turn it down halfway to not to burn the food.

 Now put the slices of bread in the plate with eggs and milk, and soak for a few seconds, but not more than Â½ minutes (one by one, not at the same time). If they are too heavy, leak milk or break when you take them out, you have had them soaking for too long.

 Do not throw them away, just use them, they will take a longer time to fry, but will be good anyway. When the bread was soaked enough, put it in the hot oil, and turn constantly until both sides are fine golden brown.

 They tend to burn fast, be careful. I cannot give you the exact amount of any of these since different types of bread need a different amount of egg / milk mixture.

 For example, one egg and half a glass of milk is usually enough for two slices of white loaf, while the same amount of egg / milk is probably at least four to five slices of dark wholemeal bread, since the darker the bread the more consistent it is. The golden rule is that if you feel that your slice of bread is not wet enough, add more eggs, beat well, add more milk and dip again.
