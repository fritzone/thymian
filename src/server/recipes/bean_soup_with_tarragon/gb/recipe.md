### Ingredients

- A good piece of smoked bone, with meat on (pork bone is best, but be careful if it is pork bone with extra salt, soak it overnight)
- For extra flavour: bacon, the more fat, the better the taste will be
- A small onion, cut into pieces
- Beans. Dry or canned. If they are white beans the soup should have a light colour, if they are kidney beans or black beans the soup will be a little darker.
- Oil, wheat flour to make a roux (thickening)
- Salt, pepper
- Tarragon vinegar

### If you like

- A small carrot, parsley root
- A tomato, small pepper, a piece of garlic, crushed
- Tomato juice

### Preparation

If you use dry beans, you must soak them in water for at least 12 hours
before starting to prepare this dish, otherwise they will not cook properly. In the
same water add a little bacon to have a better taste.
If you use beans from a tin life is easier, but the food will not taste so  good.

Start by washing the meat / bone well and cook it together with the bacon approx. half an hour or till the meat is almost tender.

If you do not use beans from tin, put the beans in cold water at the same time with the meat and bacon, and let them cook for approx. 2-3 hours, or until the beans are done and soft.

 While the meat is cooking, it is time to prepare a roux and let it cool down, for this soup we want to use cold roux. When the meat is done add the onion, carrot, parsley root and cook until the vegetables are done.

 If you use beans from tin, now is a good time to have them in.  When the vegetables are done, dissolve the roux in the hot soup (add the soup one tablespoon at a time to the cold roux and mix well so that you get liquid, and have it in the soup).

 Boil it up. After about 10 minutes of boiling, it is now time to add salt and tarragon vinegar.

Do not to forget, that the smoked bones also have a good amount of salt inside and use a spoon when you pour in the vinegar. It is easy to have more vinegar in, but a little difficult to take it out from the soup.

 Taste the soup often, until you get the perfect taste. When you serve the soup it is perfectly fine to have some fresh onion on the side, or some sour cream next to it.
