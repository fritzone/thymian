### Ingredients – for the sheets
- 250 gr. wheat flour
- 80 gr. room temperature butter
- 60 gr. sugar
- 4 tablespoons of milk
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon baking powder + a little lemon juice on

### Lemon cream
- 3 dl milk
- 3 tablespoons flour
- 200 gr. room temperature butter
- 200 gr. icing sugar
- Grated peel of 1 lemon
- Juice from 1 – 2 lemons

### Preparation
Make the sheets first. Mix the flour, butter, add the eggs and sugar, and mix well.

 Add 1 teaspoon of baking powder, add a little lemon juice to the baking powder, and mix well again. Put in the 4 tablespoons of milk, and if you need more milk to have a dough you can roll out easily just use more.

 Divide the dough into three identical sizes, use a dough stick and make 3 sheets, each approx. 30x24 cm.

 Bake the sheets on a baking sheet or on the bottom of a pan. Now you can make the lemon cream.

 Add 3 tablespoons of flour to 3 dl. milk, boil it while stirring it, careful about not getting lumps.

 Let it cool (keep the pot in cold water if you do not have much time). Use a hand mixer and make a cream of 200 gr. butter and 200 gr. icing sugar.

 Stir in the grated peel of 1 lemon. When the milk is completely cold, mix in the butter cream, and the juice from 1 or 2 lemons.

 When you taste the cream, it should be pleasantly sour, not sweet, that is the reason why I do not know how many lemons you should have them since I cannot taste the lemons you have. Divide the cream into 2 and spread them on the sheets you have made before (spread the first sheet, have cream on the first sheet also have on the second sheet, spread the second, put on the third, it is not rocket science).

 Now comes something important: you cannot eat this cake today. It must rest at least overnight, place a heavy butchers’ block on the cake, and let it rest in a cold place.

 The next day cut it into squares, add some icing sugar and the cake is done.
