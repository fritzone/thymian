Although this is nothing like a regular pancake and seems to be too complicated to prepare for a quick breakfast, do not despair. You can make it the day before, and then take it out of the fridge, because this is a food that has a rather good shelf life. Boletus or some other soft mushroom is recommended for this recipe, but do not use chanterelles or any of the other harder mushrooms. This food with Armenian origins also comes with a particularly good sauce If you like sauces.
