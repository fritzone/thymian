Chop the onion into small pieces and fry them in pan using a little oil. Add a little paprika powder, mix well, add the cleaned and diced mushrooms together with a glass of water.

 Cook until the mushrooms are soft and then take them out of the water. Use a blender, or cut them into very small pieces, or use a meat grinder.

 Do not throw away the boiling water if you want to make the sauce as well. Mix the mushrooms well with 3 eggs, 3 – 4 tablespoons of flour, salt, pepper and chopped parsley.

 Divide the batter into several pieces, shape the parts into flat slices, and fry them in hot oil. For the sauce, make a small amount of roux with oil and flour.

 Mix it with 1 glass of cold milk, season with vinegar, salt, and parsley. While cooking it, add a few spoons from boiling water until you get a sauce with a good consistency you like, and afterwards have in the sour cream.

   When serving, have sauce on or next to it.
