### Ingredients
- ½ kg of lamb or pork, preferably with bones and fat on
- 5-6 potatoes
- 1-2 carrots
- 1 small onion
- Milk and flour to make a thickening
- Salt, pepper,
- Tarragon vinegar

### If you like
- Parsley root, parsnips
- Red pepper, diced
- 1 tomato

### Preparation
If you want to use bones (to make a broth) put it in a large pot with a little salt and cook for at least 45 – 50 minutes in ca. 2 litres of water and discard the bones afterwards.

 Cut the meat into cubes and put it in the pot (with a little salt if you are not using the broth you prepared) and cook approx. 30 minutes.

 While the meat is cooking, peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes, the carrots into thin slices, the onion into large pieces and put everything into the soup with a few whole black peppercorns. If you use other vegetables, except tomatoes, have them in the soup now.

 When the vegetables and meat are soft and ready, make a thickening with flour and milk, add a little tarragon vinegar to the thickening and mix the thickening into soup.  Bring to the boil.

 If you use tomato, now is the time to have it into the soup and cook the soup until the tomatoes disintegrate.  Season with salt, and the soup is ready.
