### Ingredients
- As many large slices of meat as many portions, feel free to use beef, pork, chicken, or rabbit, washed and cleaned
- 10 - 15 carrots
- 1 - 2 parsnips and parsley root
- Some celery, or kale
- 5 - 6 garlic cloves
- 1 small onion
- Bay leaves
- Salt, whole black pepper
- Lemon juice
- Wheat flour, oil to make

### a Roux
- Macaroni, one serving portion for each slice of meat

### Preparation
Peel and cut the vegetables, put them together in a pot with the meat. Add the bay leaves, 10 - 15 black peppercorns, a little salt and cook until the meat is soft.

 When the meat is done take out the vegetables, strain off the water, do not throw it away, but put it somewhere to cool it down as quickly as possible, and now it is the time to put the macaroni to boil in salted water. Using a sieve, mash the root vegetables through the sieve with a spoon.

 Do not use a mixer, you will get a way too creamy mash and the consistency of the food will not be as expected. Return the mashed vegetables to the meat and heat them over low heat until you make a roux with the flour and oil, being careful not to burn it, you can add some of the water you saved before.

 Make a roux and dissolve it with the cold cooking liquid and put it in the pot. Mix well with the vegetable mash, season with salt and a little lemon juice.

 The macaroni should be ready, divide them between the serving plates, put on a slice of meat on each and divide the sauce between the plates.
