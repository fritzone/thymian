An extremely easy to make and flexible food recipe, with a unique taste, which does not require a large amount of TLC, but in any case, gives a surprisingly good taste you do not expect from looking at the simple ingredients you add. This food has many variations, I will present the traditional one suitable for vegetarians and also mention some other varieties with meat or eggs for those who want to experiment.
