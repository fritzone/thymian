### Ingredients
- Half a cup of rice
- 5 - 6 large onions, white or purple
- 7 - 8 red, green and yellow peppers, or whatever you find. California / Bell pepper is highly recommended because it is a very juicy species of pepper.
- 8 - 10 tomatoes, and piccolo tomatoes if the large ones have no taste
- Oil, salt, and pepper
- A hot chili If you like it.

### Preparation
Start by washing the rice and set it to boil in 2 - 2.5 cups of water and a little salt.

 While the rice cooks, put oil in a saucepan, warm it up, cut up the onions into good finger sizes and put them in the oil, which was heated in a saucepan. Stir often so that they do not burn, while cutting up all the peppers into large pieces.

 When the onions are half done and begin to become transparent (it takes about 15 minutes) put the peppers in the pot. Stir the food often while cutting tomatoes.

 After approx. 10 - 15 minutes you can put the tomatoes inside the saucepan and continue to stir.

 If you think it is dry and has no juice just pour some water into the pot. When the rice is cooked, mix it with the vegetables and let it cook for approx.

 10 minutes and the food is ready now. You can eat with strong chili or without.

  Varianter +  In some regions, this recipe is made with sausages you put in after the vegetables are done. If you cannot find a piece of Hungarian paprika sausage, I recommend some chorizo for this.

  +  Others carefully lay a raw egg on top when it is almost done to get a boiled fried egg (do not stir after the egg is added)  +  If you want, add a good deal of bacon to the oil before you start adding the vegetables. It gives an excellent taste.

  +  You can also fry some beef / pork in the oil before the vegetables, then remove, continue with the vegetables and put the meat back when the vegetables are almost done. It is not necessary to use rice in this situation.
