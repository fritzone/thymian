### Ingredients
- Potatoes
- Oil. Huge amounts of sunflower oil.

### Preparation
Peel the potatoes and cut them into thin sticks. Or cut them into flat round slices.

 Or dice. Or, if the potatoes are small, have them whole.

 Heat the oil. Some recipes say that you should heat up to a certain degree, but as mentioned in the introduction of the book, for us cooking is fun, it's not about using expensive tools and transforming our kitchen into a chemistry lab.

 Just heat it up. If you see that it does not fry the potatoes heat it more.

 If you see it burning the potato, or starting to smell, just lower the heat. You can use any pot, casserole dish, frying pan, because in time you will know the difference.

 I personally like to use my half a century old iron, 1 litre pot. Find your favourite casserole, and use it to fry potatoes, and for nothing else.

 You can actually keep the oil between two or three sessions of frying, and change it only when it gets smelly. Put the potatoes in the oil.

 With a perforated spoon made of metal, turn the potatoes around occasionally so that they do not stick together. Now it depends on how you like your fried potatoes.

 If you like them soft and moist, take them out when they are yellowish and soft to the touch of the spoon, or you can just stick them through with a fork. If you like them drier and crispier, leave them in more, until they are golden brown.

 If you have a lid on the pot, they will be softer or they will be crispier. Take them out in a bowl, which has a paper towel on the bottom and let the oil drain well.

 Taste with salt, and done. Only with salt
