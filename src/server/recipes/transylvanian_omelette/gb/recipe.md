### Ingredients
- Eggs. 2 – 3 – 4, depending on how hungry you are
- Bacon or oil, or lard
- Salt
- Bread

### If you like
- Vegetables: Red pepper, Onions
- Mushrooms
- Cheese
- Spring onions

### Preparation
In a frying pan, put a thick slice of bacon cut like a cockscomb (or oil or lard) and heat it until the bacon is melted and you have enough fat in the pan. Cut the vegetables into thin slices and fry them in the pan.

 If using onions, they should be in for at least 5 minutes before the peppers. If you use mushrooms, it should be the first into the pan, and should be fried well.

 Whisk the eggs together with a little salt in a plate, and when the vegetables are half cooked (or they are as fried as you like them) remove the pan from the stove and put in the eggs. With a thin slice of bread, dip the plate out of the eggs, and put it in the pan too.

 Put the pan back on the stove and mix thoroughly so that it does not burn on either side and does not dry out. Put in some grated cheese, and fry, but be careful that the original omelette from Transylvania should not be completely fried, dry or burnt on one side or the other, should be always a little runny.

 Decorate with some spring onions. When the omelette is done, eat it with some salad, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc...
