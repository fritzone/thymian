### Preparation
 Start by cleaning and washing the rice. Wash several times until the last water is clear.

 Let the rice stay in the water for a while, while you work with the meat. Finely chop the onion, and sauté it in the oil in a saucepan, being careful not to burn it.

 Put in the meat, cook together for a few minutes until the meat starts to brown. If you use mushrooms, keep them in boiling water for a minute and put them in the pot with the meat.

 When the meat is a little brown add the rice, water (or chicken / beef broth) and cook for approx. 10 minutes.

 You will need approx. 4 times more water than rice.

 For the first few minutes until it starts to boil, mix it often so that no rice sticks to the bottom of the pot. Now wash, peel and cut all the root vegetables (carrot, parsley root, parsnip, celery) into cubes, and put them in the pot.

 After 5 minutes add in the rest of the vegetables, extra spices and herbs, and all the other ingredients you decide to use, and cook until everything is soft. If you see that there is not enough water, just have a little more.
