Well, it's actually not risotto, but a very generic recipe for oriental pilaf (which is just plain meat with rice) that you can make with your favourite meat, whether it's pork, chicken or lamb. Enhance this very basic recipe with vegetables that you like, or maybe raisins, dried apricots and extra spices. It will not disappoint you. Giving you a specific recipe for a pilaf is actually pointless, since this is the food everyone can vary to their liking, and you can make this into your most personal food ever. So I'm just giving some directions, and from this point on it's up to you to come up with the world's best pilaf. For you, of course.
