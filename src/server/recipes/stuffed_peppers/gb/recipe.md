### Ingredients
- 4-5 small peppers, or more if you like, try to buy the smallest peppers you can find
- 250 grams of minced pork / beef, or enough to fill all the peppers
- Rice, ca. 10 grams / half glass
- Â½ liter of tomato juice
- Flour and sunflower oil to make a roux
- 2 small onions
- Parsley leaves

### Preparation
Wash the rice, and put in a saucepan, cook for a few minutes. Finely chop one of the onions, and fry in a little oil until light brown.

 Remove the rice from the pan, wash well with cold water, mix with the onion and minced meat. Season with salt and pepper.

 Clean the peppers, cut out the seeds and the green parts, you should end up with a hole on top of it. This is the place you start to fill it with rice / meat mixture.

 Fill all the peppers with rice-meat mixture and put them in a large pot. Clean and put in the other onion in the pot, cover with water and cook it for 50-60 minutes, until the meat in the paprika is cooked.

 While it is boiling, make a portion of roux with oil and flour and let it cool. When the meat is done add the tomato juice, let it boil and now it is time to mix the roux with the soup.

 Dissolve slowly the roux in the hot and boiling soup, and let it boil. When the roux is in the soup, add the parsley leaves and cook for another 30 minutes.

### Tips

- If you have not finished the filling make small meatballs, add them to the soup (and cook them), right before the tomato juice
- If you add a bit of a bone or fatty pork meat the soup will have more characteristic taste
