### Ingredients
- Potatoes. As much as you are hungry for.
- 1 carrot
- 1 – 2 – 3 small onions
- Bay leaf, 1 – 2 pcs.
- Salt, red paprika
- Oil and flour

### Preparation
Peel and cut the potatoes into thick slices or cubes (both are fine, just do it the way you like it), slice the carrot, and cook them in salted water together with the onions (whole, half-cut or finely chopped, this is also up to you) and the bay leaves. When the potatoes are done, make a thickening (roux) of oil and flour, and put it in the soup.

 In a soup spoon (or small frying pan) heat some oil, put in a teaspoon of red paprika powder, and pour it very quickly into the soup, before the paprika is to burn. Serve with some spring onions on top.
