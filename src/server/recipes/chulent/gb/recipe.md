### Ingredients
- Ca. 300 - 400 gr. dry large white haricot beans (100 - 150 gr. / person). Not from a tin.
- 1 onion
- 1 tablespoon of flour
- 2 - 3 garlic cloves
- Pork chop, 1 / person
- Beef tenderloin, 1 / person
- 5 - 10 smoked bacon slices or some other smoked meat if you prefer it that way
- Salt, pepper, tarragon, basil, oil, wheat flour, sour cream.

### Preparation
At least 12 hours before you start cooking have the beans in a large pot of water, leave them overnight. If you have naturally smoked meat (smoked without chemicals), not meat prepared with artificial smoky taste, add it to the water.

 When you start cooking: finely chop the onion and saut√© it in a good amount of oil until the onions are a little brown. Add 1 tablespoon of flour, stir together, put in the crushed garlic and 1 glass of van.

 Bring to boil and remove from the heat when it boils. Put in the beans, stir well.

 Sprinkle with the remaining spices, place the meat slices on top and cover with water, have at least 5 cm. water over the meat.

 Put the casserole in the oven and cook over low heat for at least 5 - 6 hours, until the meat is tender and soft. I have started cooking it at 180 C and slowly lowered the temperature to 120 C.

 Be careful, that there is always liquid on the beans. Once the pot is in the oven, do not stir this food, instead give the pot a quick circular shake.

 Either you eat it the day you cook it or reheat it in the oven when you want to consume it. And of course, a good spoonful of sour cream also turns this food into a delicacy.
