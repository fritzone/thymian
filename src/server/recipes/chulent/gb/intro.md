A very traditional Jewish recipe invented to circumvent the strict rules of cooking on the Sabbath, which also managed to bring a wide variety of flavours into the Sabbath in the daily Jewish life of Transylvania or for this purpose, no matter where they live in the world. Except that our incarnation of the recipe is anything but kosher. In Transylvania, this recipe was made with goose meat, stuffed goose neck, and smoked beef.
