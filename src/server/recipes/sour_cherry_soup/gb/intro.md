Strange as it may seem, you can make an exceptionally good soup from sour cherries. Do not confuse cherries with sour cherries. The sour cherries areâ€¦ well ... sour. Cherries are not so sour, are bigger than sour cherries and they are more varied. Cherries (sour or not) are not so good for this soup, since they are sweeter than expected, but I recommend making the sweet variation of this soup with cherries. Sour cherries you can find in stores but if it is not season for cherries, you can buy canned Polish (or Romanian if you find) cherries from stores that offer it.
