### Ingredients
- Ca. Â½ kg. cherries from canned. Do not throw the juice out of the box, we will use it later.
- A small onion
- Milk, flour (1 tablespoon of flour is enough) to make a thickening
- Parsley leaves
- Lemon juice
- If you use vanilla pudding instead of wheat flour, you can

### Preparation
Do not pit the sour cherries, but if you managed to find a can with pitted sour cherries that is also great. Put 1 litre of water in a saucepan, add the onion and a little salt, bring to the boil for a few minutes.

 Add half the cherries, bring again to boil, and add the juice of the sour cherries. Make a thickening from flour and milk, add a little lemon juice, and mix with the soup.

 Bring to the boil, and now add in the other part of the sour cherries. Add a little parsley and the soup is ready.
