### Ingredients
- Ca. 1 - 1½ kg. paprika. Red, green, and yellow together.

### Preparation
Cut the bacon into small cubes and put in a pan with a little oil. Cook until the bacon gets a little colour.

 Finely chop one of the onions and put in the pot together with a little lard (if you use it) and sauté the onion until it is soft and brown. Add a little pepper, the crushed garlic cloves, add the chicken pieces and cook together for approx.

 15 minutes. While they are cooking, cut the rest of the vegetables into cubes, except for the cabbage and mushrooms, which should be cut in thin slices.

 Now put the onion pieces in the pot and cook until the onion pieces are almost soft. Now put in the paprika, cook until the paprika is almost done.

 Add the cabbage and mushrooms if you use, and after 10 minutes also the tomatoes. Mix well, season with salt and pepper, chili if you like and let it cook until everything is soft, at least an extra 15 minutes.
