### Ingredients
- 500 gr. minced pork or beef
- 500 gr. minced lamb meat
- Salt, pepper
- 1 teaspoon baking soda + a little lemon juice on
- 250 - 300 ml. cold water.

### Spice mic for “Mici”
- 1 teaspoon dry oregano
- 4 - 5 allspice
- ½ teaspoon coriander seeds
- 2 teaspoons paprika powder

### Mujdei
- Garlic, about 10 - 15 cloves.
- A little oil (almost 1 tsp.)
- Vinegar (about 4 - 5 soupspoons)

### Preparation
Mix the meat, salt and pepper well. Add baking soda and a little lemon juice, and mix for a few minutes, at least 10.

 Pour in the water, one small glass each time, and mix well after each glass of water. If you feel that the meat becomes soft do not use more water, it is done.

 Put minced meat in the fridge for at least 1 hour. When you take it out of the fridge you can start making little sausages from the minced meat, approx.

 10 - 15 cm long, 3 cm thick. If you have a grill use it to grill the small sausages, if not, fry them in oil in a pan.

 The traditional fashion of eating Mici in Romania is with sweet mustard, Mujdei (see below for details) and white bread. If you have added more that you can eat, the “Mici” sausages can be kept in the freezer for up to a month or even more.

  If you want, you can make a tasty spice mix you can use with “Mici”. Use 1-2 teaspoons for the amount above, keep the rest in an airtight container.

 Put the ingredients in a mortar and pulverize well. Store it in a dry and dark place.

  “Mujdei” is a strong sauce made with garlic and oil. In Transylvania we also use vinegar in the sauce, in the rest of Romania “Mujdei” is made without vinegar, and is more like a garlic sauce.

  Crush the garlic cloves in a small but deep plate, put some oil on. Mix until you get a garlic sauce.

 Add the vinegar and mix well. Finished.

 Enjoy with food, such as “Mici” or grilled fish. Unfortunately, “Mujdei” cannot be stored for more than an hour or two, so eat it right away.
