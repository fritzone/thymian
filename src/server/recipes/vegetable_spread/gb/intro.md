This dish is known under various names in the southern parts of Europe, such as Ajvar, Lutenica, or others. Each country has its own recipe, some of them are spicy, some of them are creamier, some of them have thick vegetables, but everyone swears that they have the original food. Such is ours. Original, to our household, and if you dare to go to our neighbours they will swear that theirs is the original. Because this happens with tasty dishes. Everyone owns them. Now you have your own variety as well. Here I share with you the recipe that is made with beans, and in the tips section I will give some other variations and instructions on how to make them.
