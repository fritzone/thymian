### Ingredients
- Ca. 200 gr. of finely chopped onion.
- 200-300 gr. red peppers cut into strips.
- 300 gr. ripe tomatoes, or a box of crushed tomatoes
- 200 gr. large white beans, cooked.
- 10 – 15 whole black pepper seeds
- Salt
- 3 - 4 bay leaves
- Ca. 1 dl sunflower oil

### Preparation
Do not panic if you cannot measure out all the ingredients in grams, they are there just to give you a sense of proportion. In Transylvania we use hermetically sealed jars, which should be eaten in the winter when vegetables are rare.

 But the luxury of Western civilization has taught us that all vegetables are always available at your fingertips, without extra effort. So, you can afford to experiment.

 An important thing is that in Transylvania the local variety of a red pepper (Capsiucum annume L. var. grossum of Solanaceae) is used, which is a very meaty and sweet variety of the pepper, and which unfortunately is rarely available west of Hungary. For my recipe I have used a Bell pepper and a long and sweet "Kapia pepper", and the taste was satisfying.

 If you have raw beans, soak them in water overnight, and boil them thoroughly in water with a little added salt (this means at least 3-4 hours) before you start making this dish. Sauté the finely chopped onions in the sunflower oil over low heat until they become transparent, but do not let it brown or burn.

 This means that you have to stir them very often, almost constantly. Meanwhile, cut the red peppers into long, thin slices and when done put them together to fry with the onions.

 Let them simmer until the peppers are soft, and afterward add the tomatoes. Mix well and let it cook for at least 10 – 15 minutes.

 While they are cooking, crush some of the beans with a fork, but not all of them. Crushed beans will make the food creamier.

 Add the beans, season with a small amount of salt (do not forget that you have boiled the beans in salted water), add black pepper and bay leaf. Let it boil, still on low heat for 30 minutes or even 1 hour, and do not forget that you have to it stir often, otherwise it burns.

 When you are done, I recommend waiting for a while for it to cool down before you actually eat it, otherwise it will burn your mouth.

### Tips
- This dish can also be made with aubergines. If you plan to do this, replace the beans with grilled aubergines, do not slice the peppers, but use a meat grinder and grind the peppers before frying them, and do not use bay leaves.
- You can make this dish with mushrooms instead of beans. Cut and fry them and put them in your dish just as you would with the beans. All the rest stays the same.
- Use fried peppers instead of raw. Your food will be much creamier and closer to being a Macedonian Ajvar.
- Instead of beans, you can also use squash. Clean, cut into cubes, boil in water, and have it in with the vegetables.
- Some family recipes also use a grated carrot and garlic. We leave it to you to try out these ingredients.
- And last but not least, for the really brave ... add hot chillies.
