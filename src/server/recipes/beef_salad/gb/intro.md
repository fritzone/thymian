A traditional Romanian dish for festive opportunities, "SalatÄƒ de boeuf" has its origins in the French language, and it means "beef salad". It can be perfectly made with the leftover vegetables from a clear meat soup (Recipe 14) and some of the meat from there, but also if you cook the vegetables separately and use a little leftover cooked meat from another dish it can come out decent. Worth mentioning is that this is also a very flexible recipe, so do not worry if you do not have all the ingredients below, just leave the ones you do not have (or do not like). Except for one. Pickled cucumber. It is mandatory to have pickled cucumber in beef salad. We highly recommend making your own mayonnaise, it is a hundred times better than anything else you can get.
