### Ingredients
- 1 kg. sauerkraut.
- 75 dkg. diced pork. It's okay if the meat has a little fat on it.
- 1 large onion finely chopped.
- Salt, pepper
- Sweet red paprika
- Cumin (If you like)
- Oil and crème fraiche

### Preparation

In a large casserole add the oil and the finely chopped onion, sauté the onion until soft. Add a little ground pepper, mix with the onion, add the pork, stir well, and let it cook for approx. 30 minutes or until the meat is almost done. Add a small amount of water if it starts to burn.

   If the sauerkraut is very sour, strain the juice through a sieve, press all the juice out and wash the sauerkraut a few times.   It is perfectly fine to drink the natural juice from sauerkraut (has huge amounts of Vitamin C), or you can use the juice in a second recipe (only if it was not sour with vinegar) for example recipe 18.

   Now add the sauerkraut, mix well with the meat, add a little water, cumin, red paprika powder and cook until the sauerkraut is soft, it takes approx. 30 - 45 minutes.

 When serving, add a little sour cream and it is ready to eat.
