Although this food has the same name as the Sekler people, who live in the middle of Romania, and are the largest Hungarian-speaking minority in the country, in fact this food has its origins in Budapest in the mid-19th century, from where it spread to all Hungarian speaking areas, and was happily integrated into the cuisine of neighbouring countries as well.
