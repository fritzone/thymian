Although this food has the same name as the Sekler people, who live in the middle of Romania, and are the largest Hungarian-speaking minority in the country, in fact this food has its origins in Budapest in the mid-19th century, from where it spread to all Hungarian speaking areas, and was happily integrated into the cuisine of neighbouring countries as well. And since the food is the name of a person with the family name 'Sz√©kely', I cannot translate it, so it stays that way.
