### Ingredients
- 5 - 6 large potatoes
- 1 large onion
- Hungarian sausages with paprika (csabai, gyulai), but if you can’t find Hungarian sausages a good bit of chorizo will do it
- meat sausages (If you like). Some good Polish kielbasa will be perfect
- some bacon and diced pork if you don’t like sausages or it is possible to make the dish completely without meat
- pepper, salt, oil
- red paprika powder (not chili)
- strong pepper sauce, if you like (some good quality Sambal Oelek will do the trick)

### Preparation
Chop the onion into very small pieces, put some oil in the pan, and add the onion. Fry the onion in oil on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally so it does not burn.

 At the same time cut the sausages into slices. If you use a thick and large meat sausage, cut it in half lengthwise before.

 Now add the ground pepper to the pot, stir well and put in the sausages. If you use meat sausage, bring it in approx.

 2 - 3 minutes before the paprika sausage. Stir together, fry for approx.

 10 - 15 minutes, or until you have finished peeling the first potato. While the food is cooking, peel the potatoes, cut them into cubes, and when you have finished a potato, put it in the pot, stir together.

 After the first potato put in some water (about ¼ dl.) And of course stir again.

 Do it again (cut into cubes, put in the pot) until you have more potatoes. When you run out of potatoes and the pot is full for your needs, pour as much water to fill half of the pot, but do not cover all the potatoes.

 Now is the right time to put in salt, the paprika powder (at least two teaspoons of it). And if you like the strong pepper sauce to give a kick.

 From now on, until the food is done, every time you stir the food (and you have to do it often so as not to let it burn, every 2 - 3 min.), lift up the potatoes (and sausages) from the bottom of the pot to get all potatoes boiled properly, and do crush some of them to get a thicker sauce.

 You can have in more water if you think it is not thick enough. Enjoy this food with pickled cucumber or a salad of tomatoes, onions, cucumbers and other vegetables with vinegar.
