As many houses as many habits, and as many recipse for this timeless dish. Every household in Transylvania has its own well-kept secret recipe for this food, which was passed down from generation to generation. But everyone agrees on one thing: it needs peppers. Lots of red peppers. Nothing else is more important. It can be as thick as a stew, or more diluted as a soup (do not misunderstand this for goulash soup, that is something else, a completely different recipe). Here I share the recipe I revised from the original using substitute ingredients that I discovered at the local food market.
