### Ingredients
- 600 gr. wheat flour
- 100 gr. butter at room temperature
- 60 gr. sugar
- 4 dl milk
- 1 packet of yeast
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons lemon or orange peel, grated, mixed with 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 packet of vanilla sugar

### Walnut cream
- 120 gr. walnuts
- 100 gr. sugar
- 2 egg whites

### Preparation
Warm up 2 dl. milk (just a little, do not boil), add a teaspoon of sugar and crumble in the yeast.

 While waiting for the yeast to rise, mix the flour with the soft butter, 3 of the egg yolks, vanilla sugar and the grated lemon or orange peel. When the yeast is done, mix with the flour, add the sugar, and use the other 2 dl. milk to make a good dough. Knead the dough well.

 If it separates from your hand it is finished, put it into a bowl, cover and raise for approx. 40 minutes.

 While the dough rests make the walnut cream. Grind the walnuts if you have not bought ground walnuts.

 If you do not have a walnut grinder, use a blender. Beat the 2 egg whites until the mass starts to become frothy and a little white and add 120 gr. sugar. Make a stiff foam.

 Mix the ground walnuts into the foam and mix well. When the dough is almost double in size, knead it again, and afterwards use a dough stick and stretch the dough on a floured surface approx. 0.5 cm thick.
 Apply the walnut cream to the dough sheet and roll it up. Put it in a long loaf pan, whisk the last egg yolk, and grease the top with the egg yolk.

 Put in a hot oven and bake until it turns nice brown at 170 degrees in about 35 minutes.
