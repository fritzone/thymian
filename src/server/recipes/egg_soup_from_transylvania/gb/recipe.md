### Ingredients
- A large onion (or 2, if you like onions), a tiny amount of spring onion
- A little sunflower oil and flour to make a roux
- 2 – 3 bay leaves, red paprika powder, vinegar, salt, pepper
- 2 – 3 eggs

### Preparation
Start by making the roux. Put the oil in a saucepan, heat it, and add in the flour. Constantly stir the roux all the time so that it does not burn, just let it brown.

 When it is brown enough, add 1 (or 2 – 3) litres of cold water, bay leaf and paprika, let it boil. While the water starts boiling, chop the onion into thin slices.

 When the water boils, put in the onion slices and let it boil again for a few minutes. Now is the time to break the eggs one by one and put them in the boiling soup with a short break in between.

 Make sure to always put the egg in the boiling soup (In the same way as you would make poached eggs). When the eggs are hard-boiled, the soup is ready.

 It’s recommended to serve with a little black pepper or spring onion on. Once you have eaten all the eggs from the soup it is fine to have a few more eggs in, and re-boil the soup.
