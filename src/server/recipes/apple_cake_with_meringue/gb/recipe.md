### Ingredients
- Ca. 8 – 10 large ripe apples
- 300 gr. wheat flour
- 130 gr. butter at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon baking powder and lemon juice
- 4 tablespoons sweet (white) wine (I recommend Tokay, a sweet dessert wine from Hungary)
- 4 eggs.
- 200 gr. icing sugar
- Your favourite jam (we prefer apricot for this cake)
- A little sugar, cinnamon

### Preparation
The amounts are for a baking pan approx. 20x30 cm.

 If you have a larger one, you can increase the amount. Then you can go up to 500 gr.

 flour with 250 gr. with butter, by keeping everything else the same, if you need more softness after that, add an extra egg, a little extra wine until you get the consistency you can work best with.

 Start by separating 3 of the eggs and keep the egg whites in a bowl. Mix the flour with the butter.

 Put in the egg yolks from the 3 eggs and another powder, and on the baking powder a little lemon juice. Let the two work together for a few seconds and mix again.

 Now gradually add 4 tablespoons of white wine, by keeping the consistency of the dough firm, but not hard. Make a good and firm dough that you would make for a loaf of bread.

 Now divide it into two equal balls. Let the balls rest for a few minutes (clean the apples in the meantime and start the oven at 190 C), then take the first one and with a dough stick make a sheet of the dough, about 20x30 cm.

 Bake it on a baking tray (or on the bottom of your pan if you do not have a baking tray), it should take around 10 – 13 minutes. When you see it turn light brown take it out of the oven and set it aside, you will use it later.

  Now make a dough sheet the same size as before, but this time you need to bake it inside your pan. While the dough sheets are baking, you can peel the apples (but if you have fresh and nice apples from your garden, do not peel them) and coarsely grate the apples on a grater in a large bowl.

 Mix the apples with a little sugar (1 tbsp. should be enough) and a little cinnamon If you like it.

 When the second sheet of cake is done, remove the pan from the oven, but leave the sheet in and do not switch off the oven. Take a handful of apples from the bowl with the apples and squeeze the juice from that handful of apples with your hands in a separate bowl.

 Arrange the dry apples on the sheet in a long pan, and slowly cover the entire sheet with the squeezed, grated apples. When there are no more apples left, place the second sheet on top of the apples.

 Cover the sheet thinly with your favourite jam. Whip the egg whites until the mass begins to become frothy and slightly white and add 200 gr.

 of icing sugar. Make a firm foam, and place everything on the jam.

 Put the cake back in the oven for approx. The cake is ready now, you can eat it when it gets cold.
