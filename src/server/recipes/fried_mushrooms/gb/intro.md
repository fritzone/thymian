This delicacy is ideally made during the summer when you can pick fresh wild mushrooms. Our favourites are the saffron milk cap, but any mushroom with firm flesh will do it, such as champignon but avoid boletus, they have the tendency to turn out very mushy while frying. Be careful, always pick mushrooms you are familiar with and always take them to a mushroom control. Do not pick obviously poisonous fungi, which, for example, are large, red with white spots.
