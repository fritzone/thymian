### Ingredients
- Green beans, as much as you want
- A small onion
- 2 - 3 tomatoes
- Green parsley leaves
- Salt, sugar
- Vinegar

### If you like it more thick
- One parsley root
- Flour, oil
- 1 - 2 Garlic cloves
- Red paprika powder

### Preparation
Clean the beans and break them into finger-sized pieces. Put them in a saucepan, pour in a glass of water and boil them together with the onion (and garlic if you use) and a little salt.

 After 15 minutes, add the tomatoes and parsley leaves, and cook until the beans are soft. If you want it a little thicker, make a roux with flour and oil, mix the roux into the beans, add a little red paprika powder, and cook together for 10 more minutes.

 Taste with salt, a little vinegar and sugar.
