### Ingredients
- 30 dkg flour
- 20 dkg butter
- 10 dkg icing sugar
- 1 egg
- Grated peel of 1/2 lemon

### Preparation
Separate the eggs, pour the flour into a bowl, add the butter, and mix together. Put in the egg yolk, icing sugar and grated lemon zest and mix again with quick movements.

 From the dough make a large ball and keep it in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Use a dough stick and stretch the dough, approx.

 0.1 - 0.

2 cm. thickness.

 Use a round, large gingerbread cutter (or a strong large glass) and cut out large circles from the dough. Once you have cut everything out, lay them safely on a flat surface, gather all the rest of the dough and repeat the procedure.

 When you have no more dough left using a small gingerbread cutter, cut holes in half of the large circles. Use the freshly obtained dough to make several cakes (with holes as well).

 Wisp the egg whites a little. Place the cakes on a baking sheet in a long pan, brush the ones with holes with the wisped egg whites.

 Bake in a preheated oven at 170 degrees for 15 â€“ 20 minutes until golden brown. Take them out of the oven, let them cool, and glue it together with jam, on top should be the one with the hole on.

 Be careful, this cake crumbles.
