### Ingredients
- Beans. Preferably large whites, otherwise the soup may become darker.
- Pork that is slightly smoked, or ribs and some bacon.
- Lettuce. Iceberg lettuce is fine, little gem lettuce is better.
- Garlic, dill
- Wheat flour, milk.
- Vinegar, salt.

### Preparation
If you use dry beans that were soaked overnight, put them in a large pot, pour over ca. 2 litres of water and let them boil for approx.

 1 hour. Afterwards, put the meat in and let it cook for another 1 hour.

 If you use beans from tin, just put the meat in the water and cook for 1 hour, or until the meat is tender. Clean and cut the salad into small pieces, crush the garlic, and put them in the boiling water.

 Cook until the salad is done. If you use beans from tin, put the beans in the soup now and cook for an extra 10 minutes.

 Now make a mixture of 1 tablespoon of flour and 1-2 dl of milk. Put some vinegar in it, and have it in the soup, let it boil afterwards.

 Put the chopped dill on top, season with salt and vinegar. The soup is ready now.
