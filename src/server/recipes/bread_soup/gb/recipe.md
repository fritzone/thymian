### Ingredients
- 1-2 slices of dark wholemeal bread
- Clear meat soup / broth recipe sifted, ithout vegetables
- 1 small onion or spring nion
- 1 egg
- Salt, pepper to taste
- 1 strong chilli

### Preparation

Cut the bread into cubes and place them on the bottom of a deep plate. Cut the onions into thin slices and place them on the bread.

 Season the onion with salt and pepper and let it rest for a few minutes. Put one raw egg on the onions and be careful that the egg yolk remains intact.

 Bring the meat soup to a boil, and carefully pour the boiling soup in the plate using a ladle. Season with a little sliced strong chili, a decent amount of pepper, and consume immediately (and be careful because if it was done properly, it is still burningly hot) or keep in a warm place for serving.

### Variations 

- In another variant of this soup, you must boil the onion in the meat broth and have it together in the plate.  
- You can take out the onions from the soup if you do not like it.
- The original recipe only uses black pepper and did not use chilis, but since I have found it difficult to have a raw egg in my soup, I needed a little extra flavour to go well in this soup, that is why this soup has chili in it.
