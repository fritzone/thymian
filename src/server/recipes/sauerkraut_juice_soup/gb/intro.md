This is a typical Transylvanian winter soup, when fresh pork is available, and the sauerkraut is already sour enough to be used. If you do not make your sauerkraut, I recommend buying a box that did not get fermented with the use of vinegar, but the best thing is to make your own. Of course, a combination can be used. Do not use sauerkraut that contains sugar, vinegar or added spices. For this recipe, you only need the juice from the sauerkraut, so be sure to squeeze out all the available juice from your sauerkraut, and use the remaining sauerkraut for another dish you can find in this book, or just eat them. They contain a healthy amount of vitamin C.
