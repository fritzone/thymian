### Preparation

In a large pot cook up 1.5 litres of cold water, put in the pork in cut in cubes, add a little salt and a peeled whole onion and cook approx.

 30 minutes or until the meat is tender. Remove the foam that rises on top of the soup.

 Meanwhile, make the meatballs: finely chop 1 small onion, put a little oil in a pan, and fry them until soft but not brown. Mix the minced meat with the onion, press the garlic clove in, add the egg and rice and season with salt and pepper and make the desired amount of meatballs from it.

 Do not make them larger than a nut. Cover the meatballs with flour (put some flour in a plate, and roll te the meatballs in) so that it does not fall apart while boiling in water.

 Put them in the boiling water one by one. Grate a carrot on the smallest hole in the grater and put it in the soup. If you managed to get some fresh pork brain, put it in the sup now.

 Bring to the boil. Pour the sauerkraut juice into the soup, and bring again to boil.

 Make a small portion of roux with oil and flour, dissolve with cold water and put it in the soup, bring it to a boil again. And pour the tomato juice into the soup, bring to the boil again.

 This soup should not be very thick. Grate the horseradish on the smallest hole in the grater, put it in the soup, or on a plate next to the soup and eat them together.
