### Ingredients
- 1 small cabbage
- 1 – 2 carrots
- 1 small onion
- 4 – 5 tomatoes
- A little oregano (or summer savoury) and dill
- Tomato puree
- A little oil and flour to make a roux
- Salt and vinegar

### Preparation
Cut the cabbage into good bite-sized pieces and put them in approx. 2 litres of boiling water together with a little salt.

 Slice the carrots and onions, put them in the water together with the cabbage. Let them cook for approx. 45 min, or until the cabbage and the other vegetables are soft. Put in the tomatoes (cut into slices) and make a roux with oil and flour while the soup is boiling.

 After approx. 15 minutes after the tomatoes were put in, dissolve the roux in the soup (do not forget: cold roux dissolves in hot soup, and if you have hot roux dissolve it in cold water and put in the soup just), boil the soup again, let it boil approx. 10 minutes. Now is the time to have in the tomato puree, a little oregano (or summer savoury) and dill and cook the soup again for approx. 10 minutes until all the flavours are perfectly done. And the soup is done now.

 You can have a little extra dill on If you like, as decoration.
