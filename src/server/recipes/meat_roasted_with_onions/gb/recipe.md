### Ingredients
- Ca. 1 kg big onions
- Ca. Â½ kg small onions
- As many fillets of beef as many hungry people you cook for. We like entrecote, feel free to use tenderloin too.
- Salt, pepper, sunflower oil and red sweet paprika powder.

### Preparation
In a large frying pan (only cast iron, Teflon will not work well here) put in a little oil, and quickly brown both sides of all the fillets, taking them out on a plate. Clean and cut large onions into slices, throw them in the oil, mix well.

 Clean the small onions, throw them all in the pan, mix well. After 15 minutes of frying the onions, make a place in the frying pan for the meat, place them on the bottom of the pan, season with salt and pepper, and place the large onions on top of the slices, the small ones around the meat.

 Put on some paprika powder, 1 glass of water and boil approx. 45 minutes or until the meat is tender.

 This dish goes very well with boiled potato bites or polenta.
