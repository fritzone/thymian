### Ingredients
- Pork, if you can, get fresh pork loin. It is fine to have some fat and bones on, the soup will have more flavour with this.
- Green lettuce, approx. 1 large iceberg lettuce or 4 â€“ 5 little gem lettuces.
- Milk, flour
- Garlic, dill, a small onion and some rice.
- Vinegar, salt

### Preparation
Clean the onion and garlic and have it in a large pot have in approx. 2 litres of water and boil them up.

 Add the diced meat, the washed and cleaned rice and cook for ca. 20 minutes, or until the meat is done.

 Wash, clean and divide the salad into leaves, chop them into small pieces, add to the soup. While the soup is boiling, make a thickening of milk and flour, add a little vinegar, put it in the soup, and cook it up.

 Clean the dill and put it in the soup. Boil for a few minutes, taste the salad.

 When you like how crunchy the salad is, the soup is done. Iceberg lettuce needs a little more time to finish cooking, little gem not so much.
