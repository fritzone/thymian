### Ingredients
- 4 - 5 chicken thighs with skin on
- 1 apple, divided into two. No need to be fresh, but do not use a rotten one either
- 2 - 3 small onions
- 5 - 6 garlic cloves
- Sunflower oil
- Salt, pepper

### Preparation
Wash the chicken thighs in cold water and place them in an iron pan you are not afraid to use in the oven. Pour a good amount of oil on the chicken thighs and season them with salt and pepper.

 Cut the onion into quarters, the apples in half and the garlic into thick slices if they are large, or in half if they are small. Place the garlic slices on the chicken, the rest of the onions and apples next to it and put everything in a preheated oven at 180 degrees.

 You can stick some thin slices of garlic under the skin of the leg. Pour some water next to the chicken thighs.

 The secret behind the success of this dish is that after 30 minutes of boiling you must sprinkle with the hot liquid from the pan on the legs at least once every minute (use a spoon) so that they do not become very dry and slowly get a nice crispy and brown skin on top of the soft flesh. The cooking time is around 45 minutes, or until you get the desired colour on the legs.

 Serve with your favourite side and the fried apple and onion next to it.
