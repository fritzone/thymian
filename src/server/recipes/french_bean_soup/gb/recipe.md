### Ingredients
- Green beans, about 0.5 â€“ 1 kg. It is perfectly fine to use two or more bean varieties, for example french green /string / romano / wax beans together. Try using raw / fresh beans, the one from the tin does not have the real taste. (Do not use frozen beans to make this recipe).
- Carrots, 1-2 if small, or 1 large. Yellow or orange, do not use purple carrots.
- 1 small parsley, parsnip
- Green parsley leaves
- 1 small onion and tomato
- Red paprika powder
- Vinegar, sugar, salt, oil, and flour
- Sour cream

### Preparation
Cook up 2 litres of water with a small pinch of salt. Slice the carrot and parsley (and parsnip if you use) into small round pieces, throw them in the water, let them boil while you clean the green beans and pick off the ends.

 Break the beans into finger-sized pieces and put them in the water to boil. Clean the onion, chop it into small pieces and put it in the water as well.

 Let it cook until all the vegetables are done. Now prepare a roux.

 When it is nice and golden brown, add a cup of cold water in it and dissolve it in the soup. You can put a nice amount of red sweet paprika powder in it now and bring it to boil and let it cook for 5-10 minutes.

 If you want tomatoes, now it is time to have them in the soup and cook for another 5 minutes. Taste with salt, vinegar, and a little sugar.

 Chop the parsley leaves, toss them on the soup, and you are done. When serving, add a little sour cream.

 To have a little extra colour you can also take a large spoonful of oil, heat it over the stove, put in a spoonful of red pepper powder and immediately throw it into the soup. If the pepper turned black (it burnt, because it was kept in hot oil for too long) do not use it, make a new portion.
