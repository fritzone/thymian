### Ingredients
- 3 eggs
- Bacon, as much as you want, we recommend using a thick piece of fat bacon sliced down to the skin
- Salad (use 1 iceberg lettuce or 3 – 4 little gem lettuce, depending on how hungry you are)
- Garlic, approx. 4 – 5 cloves
- Paprika powder, salt, pepper, vinegar
- Oil, wheat flour

### Preparation
Cut into small pieces the cleaned and washed salad and put it in a large pot. Cook it in ca 2 litres of water with a little salt, along with the pressed garlic cloves.

 Separate the egg yolk from whites from 1 egg, keep the yolk. Fry the bacon in a frying pan until crispy enough, take out the bacon and keep the fat in the pan.

 Make an omelette with the two remaining eggs and the 1 egg whites in the same frying pan, use a little oil if the bacon was dry and add a little milk if you like. Put the omelette together with the lettuce, let them boil together a few minutes.

 When the lettuce is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Now take the egg yolk you have kept, whisk together with a little flour and a few spoons of soup from the pot, stir well and have it in the soup, and cook up the soup once more.

 Taste with salt, vinegar, and when you serve it have the bacon and some strong chili on top.
