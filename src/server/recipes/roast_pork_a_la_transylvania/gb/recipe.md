### Ingredients
- Some pieces of pork, preferably with a little fat on, approx. 250 - 300 gr.
- 2 small onions or shallots
- 2 - 3 cloves of garlic, crushed
- Lard / oil
- Salt, pepper

### Preparation
Put in the pork that was cut into large cubes together with the cleaned shallots, and the garlic boats in a casserole. Season with salt and pepper, add a little lard and / or oil, add a little water (enough to cover the garlic cloves) and put on the stove.

 When the water starts to boil, turn down the heat, put the lid on the pot, and let it boil until you can stick a fork into the pieces of meat without too much effort. If the water evaporates, add a little more water in order to not let it burn.

 Turn the meat a few times while it is cooking. When the meat is soft enough, remove the lid from the pan, let the water evaporate, and brown both sides of the pieces of meat, but do not let them burn.

 This dish goes very well with mashed potatoes, boiled rice or boiled potatoes. Feel free to eat with pickled cucumber or fried pepper.
