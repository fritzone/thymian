### Ingredients
- As much potatoes as you need, peeled, and cut into cubes.
- Salt
- Milk and butter
- It is fine to have in also a little Vegeta and / or a little olive oil.

### Preparation
Peel and dice the potatoes. Put the potatoes in a pot (and vegeta / olive oil if using) and cook them in salted water.

 When the potatoes are tender enough for you, pour off the water from the pot. Put in the butter, and mash the potatoes, the butter should melt into the mash.

 Use one or two forks to mash the potatoes. Add a little milk, mash more, and repeat with the milk, until you like the taste and consistence.

 This side goes very well with everything that is made from meat, and we recommend a good selection of pickles to be served with them.
