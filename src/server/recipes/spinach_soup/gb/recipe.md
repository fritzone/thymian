### Ingredients
- 2 + 1 egg
- Fat bacon
- ½ kg of spinach
- Garlic, about 4-5 boats
- 1 small onion
- salt, dill, vinegar
- Oil, wheat flour
- Pasta
- Milk
- Butter

### Preparation
Put the bacon in a frying pan and fry until done. Take the bacon out of the frying pan, and make a hard omelette from 2 of the eggs and bacon fat in the same frying pan.

 When done, cut the omelette into cubes. In a large pot boil approx. 1 – 1.5 litres of water with a little salt, put in the spinach, garlic cloves and cook until done.

 Take the spinach out of the pot, put in the omelette, bacon, the onions that were cut into pieces, the pasta and cook it until the pasta is done. While they are cooking finely chop the cooked spinach, and in a second pot melt some butter, put in the spinach and half a glass of milk, and simmer for a few minutes.

 When the onions are almost dissolved, and the pasta is well done and soft put the spinach back in the pot (along with all the juice that comes with it) and cook it for a few minutes. While the soup is cooking, make a thickening in the following way: whisk together the third egg with flour, add a little milk (approx. ½ glass) and add a little vinegar. Mix the thickening with the soup, season with salt, add a little dill and cook for ca. 10 extra minutes. Ready.
