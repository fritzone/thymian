### Ingredients
- Â½ - 1 kg of mushroom mixture. Fresh if you find, frozen also goes.
- 1 onion

### Preparation
Wash the mushrooms, cut them into pieces the size you like and throw them in boiling hot water for at least 60 seconds, but no more than two minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water, dry them.

 Finely chop the onion and fry it in oil until golden brown in a frying pan. Add a little black pepper, mix and put the mushrooms in the frying pan with the onion, add a little paprika and water, and simmer until all the mushrooms are soft enough.

 Make a thickening of milk and flour, and put it on the mushrooms, bring to a boil. Season with salt, paprika and parsley, and done.
