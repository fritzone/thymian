### Ingredients
- Ca. 250 gr. Pork meat
- Ca. 10 cm Hungarian sausage with paprika or chorizo
- A little bacon
- 250 - 300 gr. Sauerkraut
- 1 carrot
- 1 parsley root
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 small red onion
- 2 garlic boats
- Flour and sour cream
- Red pepper cream (or paprika powder)
- salt, oregano (or summer savoury)

### Preparation
Cut the pork into cubes and place it in a saucepan with the bay leaves, the onion cut into thin slices and pressed garlic cloves. Cook for ca.

 30 minutes. While it is cooking, cut the bacon into cubes and fry them.

 When the bacon is done, combine with the meat. While they are cooking, cut the carrot and parsley root into slices, and add them into the pot as well.

 After 30 minutes put in the sauerkraut (if the sauerkraut is very sour just wash with a cold water a few times) and cook until the meat is soft enough. Make a thickening with a tablespoon of sour cream, and half a tablespoon of flour.

 Dilute it with juice from the soup, and then mix it together with the soup. Bring the soup to the boil and let it cook for 10 minutes.

 Season with salt and paprika cream, a little oregano (or summer savoury) and when serving, add a little sour cream. The soup is ready.
