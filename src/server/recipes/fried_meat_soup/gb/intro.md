This soup is another example of the practical ways of how ancient Saxons lived in Transylvania: let's reuse everything, nothing should be wasted. And they were right. This soup I actually made from a little grilled rib I bought 4 â€“ 5 days ago, and which was too dry to be eaten as it is, but refurbished in a soup gives it a brilliant taste.
