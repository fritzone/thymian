### Ingredients
- Garlic cloves, at least 10, but best if you have around 20. Crush approx. half of them.
- Milk (or whipped cream), flour to make a thickening.
- Salt, vinegar
- Red pepper, or paprika cream
- Strong peppers to have some flavor
- Eggs, 2 – 3 – 4 to make an omelette, + 1 raw.
- Chicken. No specific parts, use the ones you prefer
- Spring onion, the green part to decorate

### If you like
- A handful of green peas

### Preparation
If you use meat: in a saucepan put in a little oil, and fry the meat in the oil for 5 minutes. Add a little of the crushed garlic cloves and paprika cream after the 5 minutes of frying.

 Continue from the next step. If you do not use meat: In a saucepan put in a little oil, half of the crushed garlic cloves and paprika cream and fry for 1 minute.

 Continue from the next step. Next step: Put in the raw egg now, stir very well and pour over boiling water, approx.

 1 dl. Let them boil up and now is the time to fill the pot with water.

 While the soup is cooking, make a thickening with 1.5 tablespoons of flour, and milk and / or whipped cream.

 When the thickening is done, add a little vinegar to the thickening and add it to the soup. Bring to the boil, add red peppers as much as you like, season with salt and more vinegar.

 Put in all the remnants of the garlic (crushed and whole) and if you use green peas add them now. Now make a ridiculously hard omelette with the rest of the eggs, cut it into small cubes, and put it in the soup.

 Boil the soup for a few minutes, decorate with spring onions or green garlic leaves, and it's done.
