In Transylvania, the grilled meat is mainly made from pork. Beef did not enter the culinary areas, due to the fact that cattle were more useful around the house than a pig, and lamb is used mostly around Easter. When the time came for a cow, it was already too old to grill, so the meat had to be used in different ways, such as long and slow cooking in a meat soup or other recipes where you can cook the meat long enough to become soft and edible.
