### Ingredients
- Pork in slices. Neck, tenderloin, ribs with meat or any other part you prefer,
- Salt, pepper
- Lard
- Oil, garlic
- Red wine

### Preparation
Wash and dry the meats before using them. I recommend marinating the meat in oil together with garlic for at least 12 hours, or overnight before making the grill, but it goes just fine without marinating as well.

 After marinating, remove the meat from the marinade, wipe dry and clean the marinade. Add salt and pepper to the meat.

 Use a meat club to tenderize the meat. In a frying pan have some lard (or oil), heat it up and toss in the pork.

 Bake for a few minutes on both sides, add a little red wine and let it evaporate. Do not experiment with fancy techniques, such as a flamb√©ing.

 Those are used in French recipes. If there is fat on the side of the meat, rotate the meat so that only the fat part touches the bottom of the pan sometimes.

 When done, take it out of the pan, serve with the side dishes you prefer. About the meat It works just fine if you use neck chop, roast pork, pork fillet, tenderloin or other pork pieces.

 Each of these has a different taste, and since we do not make fast food, it is perfectly okay to experiment what you like more. If there is some fat next to the meat it is good, more flavor you will get.
