### Ingredients
- 1 lettuce
- Garlic, 10 – 15 cloves
- 1 egg
- Sour cream
- Salt, vinegar

### If you like
- Bacon

### Preparation
Cook up 1 or 2 litres of water, add salt, throw in the cleaned garlic, half of them can be crushed. Let it cook for a few minutes.

 Put in the lettuce that was cleaned and cut into bite-sized pieces. Boil for 1 minute.

 Now break the egg, separate the egg yolk from the white, whisk the egg yolk well with 1 tablespoon of sour cream. Store the white in a cool place until you need it for another recipe (usually survives overnight in the fridge).

 Add a few spoonful’s of the soup to the egg yolk / sour cream mixture well, and pour it into the soup. Season with vinegar and salt.

 If you like the taste of bacon, it is time to fry it and toss it over the soup. Do not boil the soup from now on, just heat it gently because of the raw eggs, and eat it in a day or two.

 Keep it in a cold place. This soup can be eaten even cold on hot summer days, and it is perfectly fine to have some polenta with feta on the side of the soup.
