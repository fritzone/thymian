### Ingredients
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- Beef, ca. 250 gr, diced
- Potato, ca. 1 kg, cut into cubes
- Salt, pepper
- Sweet red paprika powder
- Tagliatelle

### If you like
- 1 big tomato
- Chili (if you like it spicy)
- Cumin

### Preparation
Start in the same way as you would make a goulash (hence it is called a goulash soup): chop up the onion, have some oil in the pan, and add the onion, let it simmer. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes, cut them into cubes.

 When the onion is done (approx. 10 – 15 min) put in the meat, stir for a few minutes, and pour in the potatoes.

 Fill the pot with water, season with salt and pepper, sweet paprika (and spicy ones if you use) and let it cook until the potatoes are done. Stir occasionally.

 If you think it is not thick enough, add the tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes are disintegrated. Now put in the tagliatelle and cook until the pasta is cooked through.

 This will make the soup thick and as you’ll discover, tagliatelle is really fun to eat with a tablespoon. Cumin and strong chili can be used to give an extra taste to the soup.
