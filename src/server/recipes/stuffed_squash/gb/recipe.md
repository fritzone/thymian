### Ingredients
- 2-3 zucchini or squash
- 250 gr. minced pork
- A handful of carrot, parsley root, parsnip mixture
- 1 soup spoon rice
- 2 small onions
- Wheat flour, milk
- Dill
- Salt, Pepper, Vinegar
- Sour cream

### If you like
- Red paprika powder / cream
- 2 - 3 garlic cloves

### Preparation
Wash and cook the rice until it is almost done, approx. 8-10 minutes.

 Put on to boil the carrots, parsley and parsnip pieces in a casserole. Finely chop one of the onions, mix it together with the minced, salt, pepper, and the half-cooked rice (and the crushed garlic if you use).

 Clean and peel the squashes and cut them into two or three pieces. With a sharp but small spoon (grapefruit spoon works very well for me) hollow out the squash pieces and fill them with the minced meat mixture.

 If there is any meat left, make meatballs from them. Put the squash pieces you carved out from the squashes together with the other onion and the carrot - parsnip - parsley root mixture in the casserole and cook until the squash pieces are soft (about 15 minutes).

 Put on a plate some flour, dip the meaty part of the squash in, and put the squashes into the boiling water. If you have meatballs, roll the meatballs in flour before you have them in the water.

 Cook together until everything is soft. Make a thickening with milk and flour, add a little vinegar, and mix it into the soup, bring to the boil.

 Season with salt and vinegar, a little paprika powder or cream. Bring to the boil again and before serving, add a little sour cream to the serving plate.

 Serve with a little dill on.
