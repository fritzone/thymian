- 10 – 15 carrots

### Preparation
Since the meat and bones can come frozen, thaw them first. Do not use a microwave oven, it will damage the meat.

 Leave the meat in cold water overnight, or two - three hours before you start cooking. When the meat is thawed use a kettle to boil some water, and when the water is boiled, pour it over the bones (only the bones, not the meat).

 Let them rest for a few minutes in the warm water. Discard the water.

 Repeat until the last water you throw away is clean. Meanwhile wash the meat with cold water, several times.

 Now put cold water in a large pot, put in the bones, the meat, salt, and pepper and allow to boil on low heat for at least an hour. Watch it eagerly, when brown foam rises, remove it from the top, so you get a clear soup.

 If you do not remove the foam, the soup will not be so clear, but will have an oilier taste. Decide what you want and it is ok to try both varieties.

 When you do not see more foam on top, it is time to put in the vegetables. If you go for the clearest meat soup, clean the inside of the pot with a clean cloth above the water level after reducing the heat so that it does not boil so heavily but do not stop the boiling process.

 Peel and grate the vegetables, you can cut them into large pieces or keep them whole. From now on, just let the soup boil for approx.

 4-5 hours on the lowest possible heat, so that it does not evaporate rapidly, and the bones and pieces of meat are still well cooked to extract all the flavour. Strain before serving.

 When the soup is done, take out the vegetables and serve them with the soup, eat them as they are or make a salad (like salad de boeuf) with it.
