- A little butter, approx. 1 teaspoon
- Whipped cream
- Sour cream
- The yolks from 1 egg (If the eggs are small use 2)

### Preparation
Wash the lamb and separate the bones from the meat. Have the bones, and ribs with a little fat and salt in approx.

 2 litres of water (adjust the amount of water if you have more or less meat) and boil approx. 1 – 1.5 hours. While it is cooking, cut the remaining meat into cubes.

 When you have a strong lamb broth, filter the water into a saucepan, use a strainer (if you have a dog, it will be happy to get the boiled bones after cooling), and in the broth have in the lamb, a little butter, the whole onion, tarragon, and a few black peppercorns and cook on low heat until the meat is tender. If you use a small canvas bag and put in it the vegetables, onion, tarragon and pepper you can take them out afterwards and have a clear soup.

 When the meat is cooked, make a light roux from a little oil and flour, while hot dissolve it with cold water, mix it in the soup and cook approx. Add 1 tablespoon of sour cream, tarragon vinegar and bring to the boil again.

 Before serving, whisk the egg yolks with whipped cream, mix it into the soup, and done.
