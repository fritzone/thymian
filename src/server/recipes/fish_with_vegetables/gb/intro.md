As you have observed so far, fish recipes are underrepresented in this book. The reasons for this are that there is not too much water in Transylvania, and definitely no sea, just fresh water. There are a few rivers, which are home to a few specific fish species (and they are certainly cooked in the most ingenious and tasty ways in Transylvania), but unfortunately these fish are not native to English speaking countries (for example asp) or difficult to find in stores (of course if you are the type who fishes in lakes and rivers, you may come across them, such as carp or pike), so sharing a recipe with a fish you may not be able to make would be inconsiderate at its best. There is obviously the generic 'take a piece of fish and fry it' recipe, but that is not worth mentioning, so this fish recipe we present here is something you will not have problems making it, because you can make it with which any fish you like and can get your hands on, even a mix of different fish.
