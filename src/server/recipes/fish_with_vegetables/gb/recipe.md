### Ingredients
- 2 - 3 parsley roots
- 2 - 3 carrots
- Handful of peas
- 1 medium onion
- 2 - 3 pieces of fish. I used cod, of course you use your favourite fish
- 1 egg
- Sour cream
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Wheat flour
- Tarragon and oregano
- Salt, tarragon vinegar

### Preparation
Peel and cut the carrot and parsley lengthwise. Put in a saucepan approx.

 in 1 litre of clear beef soup (it is ok to use only water with salt in if you do not have it, or just throw in two cubes of beef broth) have in the carrot and parsley root, the cleaned onion and a handful of green peas. While cooking, make a light thickening (roux) with butter and flour.

 When the vegetables are cooked and soft take the vegetables out of the water, place them on your serving plate and keep them in a warm place, and let the water still boil. When all the vegetables are removed dissolve the thickening in the vegetables' boiling water.

 Add the tarragon, tarragon vinegar, oregano, the fish and cook it over low heat so that the fish remains whole. When the fish is cooked, take it out of the boiling water and place the fish on the vegetables, keep it at a warm place.

 Whisk the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, put them in the water, bring to the boil, reduce it till it is saucy enough for you and put on the fish.
