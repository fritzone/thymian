### Ingredients
- 1 large cauliflower
- 1 potato
- 1 tablespoon rice
- Butter and flour to make a thickening
- Salt and pepper
- Yolk from an egg
- Sour cream
- Green parsley

### We really recommend
- Fried duck or goose liver

### Preparation
Add the rice with a little salt in a pot and bring to the boil in ca. 2 litres of water.

 While it is boiling, wash the cauliflower, and separate it into free-standing florets, cut the root into small pieces. Wash and peel the potato, cut into small cubes and put both in the soup.

 While the vegetables are cooking, make a light roux with butter and flour. Do not let it burn and darken, and let it cool some space.

 When the vegetables are soft, strain some water from the soup into a bowl and store it in a warm place. Take out some large and nice cauliflower florets (they will be decorations when you serve the soup) and have half of the soup in a blender, mix it and have it back in the soup.

 If you do not want to use a blender, use a fork, and press the large pieces to smoothen them out to make the soup thicker. Now cook up the water you have filtered from the soup and then dissolve the thickener you made in it and have everything back in the soup.

 Mix well, bring to the boil again and then remove from the heat. Whisk the egg yolk with sour cream, mix it into the soup, and done.

 If you would like a special taste, when serving put on strips of freshly fried liver next to the saved cauliflower florets, decorate with parsley leaves.
