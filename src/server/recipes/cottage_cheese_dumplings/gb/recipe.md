### Ingredients
- 250 gr. cottage cheese
- 2 eggs
- 30 gr. butter (room temperature)
- 1 pinch of salt
- ca. 50 - 75 gr. semolina
- oil
- ca. 50 gr. breadcrumbs
- a little sugar

### Preparation
Finely chop and mash the cottage cheese using a fork along with the butter, a little salt and egg yolk. Make a hard foam from the egg whites and mix with the cottage cheese and semolina.

 Leave it in the fridge for about 1 hour. Boil lots of water with a little salt.

 First, make one dumpling: form an egg-sized dumpling from the dough with your wet hand and place it in the boiling water (the dumplings, not your hands). If it falls into pieces during or after cooking, add more semolina.

 It will not be so airy anymore, but it will stay together. When you have the right consistency, throw the dumplings in the boiling water.

 Cook approx. for 10 minutes, on moderate flame.

 Fry the breadcrumbs in a little oil, take the dumplings out of the water and roll them in the fried breadcrumbs. Before serving, sprinkle with a little sugar.
