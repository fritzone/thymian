### Ingredients
- Bay leaf – 2, 3 pcs.
- Salt, pepper, vinegar
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- Beef, ca. 250gr, diced. if you do not have beef, use lamb or pork
- Potato, ca. 1 kg, cut into cubes
- Red paprika powder or paprika cream
- Milk and wheat flour for a thickening

### Preparation
  Peel and finely chop the onion, add a little oil to the pot, add the onion, and sauté the onion until it is slightly browned but not burnt. When the onion is almost done, have a little ground pepper on the onion, mix well and put the meat in the pot.

 Stir, mix well so that it does not burn and add a small amount of water, put in the paprika powder (or paprika cream) and cook it up. Peel the potatoes, cut them into cubes (approx. 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm) and when the meat is almost done (after approx. 10 - 15 min) put in the potatoes in the pot, pour in 1 - 1.5 litres of water, put in the bay leaves and bring to the boil.

 When the potatoes are done (depending on the potato variety it can take up to 30 minutes) make a thickening of milk and flour, add a little vinegar to the thickening and add the thickening to the soup. Bring again to the boil.

 Remove the bay leaves, season with salt and pepper and serve hot.  

### Variations

It gives another tasty soup if at the end you add in some precooked green beans and season with dill (it will be a variation of a Hungarian soup called “Palóc soup”).

### Tips

It is perfectly acceptable to use yesterdays’ “Pepper Tokány” as a base for this soup.
