### Ingredients
- 200 gr. yellow corn flour (or Polenta flour)  
- Salt
- White Cheese. We like Feta.
- 600 ml water

### Preparation
In a pot boil up the water, add a little salt, and slowly sprinkle in the polenta flour. Cook over low heat while stirring until the polenta has thickened.
 Cut the white cheese into cubes, place the polenta in deep plates and place on the white cheese.  

### Tips

The possibilities for polenta are endless. You can enjoy it with:

- White cheese and sour cream
- Milk, Kefir, sour milk, or yoghurt
- Fry the leftovers from yesterday and put it in an omelette
- Polenta in layers: in a casserole add a layer of bacon, then repeat 1 layer of polenta and 1 layer of white cheese until you still have more and place it in the oven for 30 minutes
- Fried in lard and onions
