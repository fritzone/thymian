### Ingredients
- Chicken meat (It is perfectly fine to use the rest from a grilled chicken or yesterday's fried chicken)
- 2 carrots
- 1 parsnip and parsley root
- Small celery
- 1 small onion
- 1 tomato
- Sour cream
- Salt, vinegar
- Oil, flour

### Preparation
Cook up 1 litre of water in a pot, add a little salt, and the meat, boil approx. 10 â€“ 15 minutes or a little more until the meat is soft again.

 Now peel, slice, and add the carrot, celery, parsley root and parsnip. After 10 minutes add the onions and cook until the onions are soft as well.

   Add the tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes disintegrate.   Make a light and light roux from the oil and flour, and mix into the soup, bring to a boil.

   Taste with salt and vinegar, and when serving, add a little sour cream to the plate. This is a very flexible basic recipe.

 Feel free to add more vegetables (potato, kale, kohlrabi, pea, green beans), and you can even make it from different types of meat, such as veal, pork, etc, only your imagination is the limit.
