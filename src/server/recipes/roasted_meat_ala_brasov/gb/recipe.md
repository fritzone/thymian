### Ingredients
- ½ kg of pork chop
- 100 gr. pork liver
- 100 gr. ribs
- 100 gr. mushrooms (I have used chanterelle)
- 2 large onions
- 1 DL. Red wine
- ½ l. tomato juice
- Salt, pepper, parsley
- Flour, oil

### Preparation
Cut the meat into slices, for each person a slice, and use a meat tenderizer to flatten them. Cover each slice with wheat flour on both sides and fry in an iron frying pan for a few minutes in hot oil.

 While the meat is frying, finely chop the onions, and put them in the pan with the meat, and let them simmer together. While they are frying, cut the pork liver into cubes, the ribs into long sticks, and the mushrooms into slices, and when you are done cutting have everything into the frying pan.

 Add red wine, mix well and cover the frying pan with a lid. Boil for 15 minutes, and add the tomato juice.

 Cook for at least 10 minutes or until the meat is tender. When serving, add the finely chopped parsley, serve with hard boiled new potatoes.
