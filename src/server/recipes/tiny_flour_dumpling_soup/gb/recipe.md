### Ingredients
- 1 egg, flour, salt for the dumplings.
- 2 – 3 potatoes, 1 – 2 carrots,
- 1 spring onion (white part cooked in soup, green part as decoration)
- Green parsley leaves
- Red paprika powder
- Salt
- Oil

### Preparation
The first thing you need to make are the tiny flour dumplings: mix the egg with as much flour as it takes and make a very hard dough out of it. Make a ball out of it and grate it on the biggest hole on your grater you can find.

 Let it dry for a few minutes spread on a flat surface. It's ok if you want to make small dumpling balls out of some of them just for fun.

   While the dumplings dry, cut the potatoes into cubes, and grate the carrot with the same grater as before, cut the white part of the spring onion into tiny pieces. Put the vegetables in boiling water with a little salt and vegeta, and let it cook until the vegetables are done.

 Put in the dry dumplings and cook until soft. Take a large spoonful of oil, heat it over the stove (use a small pan), put in the green of 1 spring onion in small pieces fry for half a minute, and put in a little spoonful of red pepper powder and immediately throw it into the soup.

 Decorate with parsley leaves and the green part from the spring onion.
