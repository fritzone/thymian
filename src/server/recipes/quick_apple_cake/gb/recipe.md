- 4 eggs
- 1 packet of vanilla sugar
- 1 packet of baking powder
- 5 tablespoons flour
- 1 teaspoon rum
- 10 tablespoons of milk
- a little salt and lemon juice

### Preparation
Mix the eggs with vanilla sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, a little salt and 4 tablespoons flour. Add the baking powder, with a little lemon juice, stir well and mix in the rest of the ingredients, and mix until you have a batter that is similar in consistency to pancake batter.

 Pour half of the dough into a pan and put it in the pre-warmed oven for 3 minutes (180 C).   Take it out of the oven and grate 1 kg of apple on it.

 Sprinkle with two spoons of sugar, a little cinnamon if you use, pour on the rest of the batter, and have the cake back in the oven.   Bake until nicely browned, remove, add a little icing sugar.

 Serve hot.
