### Ingredients
- Potatoes. Small, fresh potatoes are the best, otherwise dice them up
- Butter
- Salt, pepper, dill

### Preparation
Wash and peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes. If the potatoes are fresh, it is fine to use them unpeeled.

 If the potatoes are small, you do not need to cut them up. In a pan that has a lid, have for approx.

 45-50 gr. butter, and melt it.

 Put in the potatoes, mix well with the melted butter. Put the lid on, cook for 30 seconds, remove the lid, mix, and repeat.

 It is of utmost importance that you mix them very often so that they do not burn, and between mixing keep on the lid that they boil soft. When you consider the potatoes to be done (25 - 40 minutes, depending on the potatoâ€™s type), remove the lid, sprinkle the potatoes with finely chopped dill, and mix constantly for the next minute so that the potatoes get a yellow-brown colour.

 Season with salt, pepper, and extra dill. This side dish goes very well with fried chicken, or any stew with meat that has a little sauce on.
