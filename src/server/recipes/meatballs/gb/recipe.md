### Ingredients
- Minced meat. Usually pork, but it's fine to have 50% of pork and 50% of beef.
- A small or medium-sized onion, if you have more than 500g of minced meat use a large onion.
- Garlic, crushed
- A medium-sized potato
- 2 - 3 slices of old bread without crust and some milk.
- 1 egg, or two if you want to make a large portion
- Salt, pepper

### Itâ€™s acceptable to put in
- 1 grated carrot
- Small amount of finely chopped parsley, dill
- 2 - 3 tablespoons of breadcrumbs

### Preparation
Start by adding the bread to the milk until approx. 5-10 minutes to soften.

 Meanwhile, mix together the minced meat with the crushed garlic. Clean and grate the onion and potato, use the smallest hole on your grate, mix well with the minced meat.

 Add the bread and some of the milk, mix together. Now it's time to add the eggs, pepper and salt to taste.

 Mix well, at least 10 minutes, you will get a well homogenized taste by mixing for 10 minutes or more. Keep it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

 Use a large frying pan, and have a little oil, approx. 200ml, or more.

 The meatballs need lots of oil to fry. The oil should not be extremely hot, because it will burn the outside of the meatballs, and leave the inside raw.

 Take the minced meat out of the fridge, put some oil on your hands (because the meat will not stick to your hands if they are oily) and start making round meatballs. It is recommended for every meatball to be the same size, but it is actually up to you.

 When they are done, press them with the palm of your hand so as not to be round as a ball, but more flat so that the centre also fries well. Put them in oil, it is fine to have for 5 - 6 or more at a time, fry on both sides alternating 1-2 minutes, until they are brown.

 You can enjoy meatballs with mashed potatoes, rice, or all the vegetable stews we have in this book. Or just with some tasty tomatoes and a slice of bread.
