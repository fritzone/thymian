### Ingredients
- Chicken breast, 1 per serving
- For each chicken breast 1 large carrot and one large onion
- A little ginger
- Salt, pepper, oil
- Tarragon vinegar
- Oregano

### Preparation
Cut the chicken breasts into finger-sized stripes, sprinkle with oregano, ground black pepper and a little oil, mix and let it rest while you cut the carrot and onions into long stripes as well. In an iron frying pan, add a little oil, put in the chicken breasts and fry on high heat until browned.

 Take out the chickens, add the onion and carrot, and a little water and simmer under a lid until the vegetables are soft. When they are soft enough, remove the lid, let the water evaporate, and keep the fried chicken pieces in.

 Mix well, add a little salt and tarragon vinegar, and serve with boiled rice or polenta.
