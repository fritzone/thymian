This is a very classic Hungarian dish, and if you want to try it with other meats, such as veal or pork give it a try. The name “paprikas” is very difficult to translate, in Hungarian it means “with paprika”, but in fact it is a type of goulash made with paprika and thickening of milk and wheat flour. This recipe is different from the original from Hungary, because in our family in Transylvania we do not use red pepper and tomato either, instead we have 2-3 mushrooms cut into cubes.
