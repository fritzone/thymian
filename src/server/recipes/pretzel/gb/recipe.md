### Ingredients
- 500 g flour
- 1 glass / 250 ml milk
- 7 g yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp cooking oil
- 1.5 tbsp baking soda
- 1 egg

### Decoration
- Sea salt, poppy seeds, sunflower seeds or sesame seeds
- Ground walnuts
- Grated cheese

### Salt cream
- 4 tbsp flour
- 2 teaspoons of salt
- Water

### Preparation
Put the yeast in warm milk and a spoonful of sugar, stir well, let it rest until it starts to rise. Mix the yeast (with milk) together with wheat flour and oil and make a hard but flexible dough.

 Let it rest for 10 minutes, and afterwards divide into as many parts, as many pretzels as you want to make. Roll them out for approx. 60 cm long rods, and then fold them into pretzel form. In a large pot, add water and baking soda and bring to the boil.

 Put in the pretzels, one at a time and cook each for 30 seconds. Take them out of the water and let them rest for 15 minutes.

 While they rest, make the salt cream: mix 4 tablespoons of flour with 2 tablespoons of salt, and enough van to get a cream that is as thick as sour cream. Afterwards, beat the eggs and brush the pretzels with them.

 If you want some decoration on them, now it's time to decorate. Bake the pretzels in a preheated oven at 200 C for about 10-15 minutes otherwise until they lead golden brown.

 If you want to add salt cream, take out the pretzels after approx. 10 minutes (when they are not golden brown yet, but they are approaching), put on salt cream (use a small spoon) and have the pretzels back in the oven for a few minutes, no more than 5.
