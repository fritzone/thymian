### Ingredients
- 400 gr. wheat flour
- 20 gr. yeast
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 dl. milk
- 250 gr. cottage cheese or feta cheese
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- Some fresh dill, salt, 1 clove of garlic
- Lots of sunflower oil

### Preparation
Heat 1 dl. milk, add a teaspoon of sugar and crumble in the yeast.

 While waiting for the yeast to rise, mix the flour, a little salt, and the egg yolk. When the yeast is done, mix it with the flour, and enough milk to have a medium-hard dough.

 Cover with a clean cloth and leave in a warm place for approx. 30 minutes otherwise until it is almost twice the size, but not more than 1 hour.

 Using a dough stick, stretch the dough into a sheet, approx. 2mm. - 5mm. thickness. Use a round gingerbread form (approx. 20 cm in diameter) and cut out round pancakes. Use the remaining dough to make more pancakes.

 Mix together 250 gr. cottage cheese with 2 tablespoons sour cream, a little salt and finely chopped dill.

 On the middle pf each of the pancakes add a teaspoon of the mixture and roll it up like a pancake. Using the dough stick, gently stretch the pancakes so that they will be flat again, without squeezing out the cheese mixture.

 Let them rest for a few minutes and fry them in hot oil on both sides. While frying, make a garlic cream from the remaining cheese mixture by mixing it well with a crushed garlic and a little oil.
